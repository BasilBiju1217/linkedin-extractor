They did a revenue of 90,000cr in FY25. Hard to think of another company in the world that has done something similar. Notes on what i think they got right..

1) They innovate at cooperative speed not startup speed and still wins. Launched 250 product launches in 5 years and that's crazy speed for a cooperative with millions of farmers, 18000+ village societies, and government-linked processes. Most companies will shiver at this speed.

2) They turned cold chain into a moat decades before most startups spoke about supply chain tech. They run India’s largest cold supply chain with refrigeration networks across rural area and temperature controlled logistics in small towns. This single capability lets them enter any nutrition category quickly.

3) The nutrition transition feels like farmer driven. More milk production means surplus fat & SNF (casien, whey , lactose) and therefore opportunity to create value added products. Every new category like whey, chocolates, drinks, cheese, creates more value for farmers. Most nutrition brands optimise for margins but they optimise for farmer income.

4) Amul is probably the only brand that simultaneously sells mass and premium products all under same brand,  same dairy and distribution and with same trust. Their products range for Rs 5 to 500. Most brands split into sub brands while Amul let the trust carry everything.

No obsession with burn, CAC ,CM1/2 growth and branding.

Never been a better time than now for Indian engineers to build at home. The US was the promised land for Indian engineers but not anymore. And India isn’t the India of the 90s when engineers moved out for better pay and exposure. 

Earlier generations left India because they didn’t have a choice. Today, staying back is the smarter choice. The US is telling the world that they want fewer immigrants, at higher prices & under tighter conditions. 

In the 1960s & 70s, US actively recruited Indian doctors and engineers to fill shortages. In the 90s & 2000s, IT/software outsourcing made H-1B the obvious path for thousands of engineers. In reality, the India of today is not the India many left behind. 

This is not to say India is without its own constraints. We still have infrastructure gaps and bureaucracy is still frustrating.
But if you look back at history, Indian engineers have always thrived precisely in moments of constraint. 

The outsourcing opportunity of the 90s was born from wage arbitrage. The SaaS opportunity of the 2010s came from building global software with frugal & distributed teams. Each cycle has taken adversity and Indian entrepreneurs turned it into advantage.

The next cycle will be no different. The very inefficiencies of India around fragmented supply chains, healthcare gaps, broken education models will be the anchor to build world class companies. To solve for India is to solve for the future of other emerging markets.

This is the great inversion of our time and for the first time in history, the opportunity cost of leaving India may be greater than the opportunity cost of staying.

So I thought to do a breakdown on what’s hype and what might actually work in India. 

What could work?
1)30–60 min medicine delivery can work for chronic refills or acute needs. In metros with dense demand, it's useful. But 10-min isn’t necessary. Even same-day is fine for 90% of use cases. And honestly, your local chemist is already doing that.

2) Rapid diagnostics for home blood collection isn’t about speed but it’s about hygiene and reliability. A 2-hour sample pickup and next-morning results is a solid win. What we need is better logistics and trained phlebotomists, not faster scooters.

3)On-demand nursing or paramedic visits but for use cases like wound care, IV, injections. Could work with proper scheduling. Think “Ola for nurses,” not “Blinkit for bandages.” Needs backend infra for verification, training, EMR integration.

What won’t work (At least not now)
1) Ambulance in 10 mins sounds great until you hit Delhi or Bangalore traffic. Speed is useless without triage and location accuracy. What we really need is better coordination between hospitals and ambulance providers, not just faster wheels.

2) On-demand doctors in 10 mins is a bad idea. You don’t need any doctor fast but you need the right one. Discovery & matching are bigger problems than speed. Most video consults struggle with quality, not timing. Clinical care isn’t fast food. Trust takes time.

3) The 10-min everything app for healthcare is lazy ambition dressed up with VC money. Healthcare isn’t a SKU game but it’s complex, regulated, and hard to standardize like groceries. Great for funding buzz, terrible for trust and real outcomes.

Few thoughts if you really are passionate to build in healthcare. 
Trust > velocity.
Speed isn’t everything.
Infra & people ops > APIs.
Reliability > 10-min hacks.
Health is longitudinal & not transactional.

India’s infant mortality rate is about 25 per 1,000 births. That’s 2.5% of infants who don’t survive. The sad part is that nearly 60% of these deaths are preventable with better care. 

This is where I believe AI in healthcare can truly make a difference. 
We can develop predictive models for at-risk pregnancies using maternal health data. Build remote monitoring systems that flag early signs of preterm labor. Even use image based diagnostics to catch neonatal infections before they turn fatal.

I know it sounds crude but what it means is Indian doctors have a life expectancy that’s nearly 10 years shorter than the average Indian. And this is reported by Indian Medical Association. 

The primary causes are Cardiovascular disease and infections. Ironically, the very things they work tirelessly to prevent.

Endure 10-12 years of medical education with the only aspiration to save lives but be at the receiving end of stress, anxiety, and long working hours. And be a part of a system that doesn’t give them time to care for their own health. The average Indian doctor clocks 60–80 hours a week and approx 300-400 doctors die by suicide every year. Mostly because of the impossible expectations they carry. It takes 10+ years of study before a doctor sees their first salary.

They’re taught that saving lives is everything. After 10hrs+ of work, you can then go and figure your own personal health & family life. And after all this, they’re now told that AI will make them obsolete. That their jobs will be replaced by software tools because the system is inefficient.

I meet atleast 50 companies a month that pitch AI solutions for healthcare. These tools matter and they can make processes faster and improve accessibility. No doubt Indian healthcare needs better processes and better tech. But what it needs more than anything is empathy.

India’s hospitals are crowded and the health crisis is real. But what’s also been ignored is the mental and physical health of our doctors & medical staff.

When people say AI will replace doctors and teachers in the next decade. They  assume that intelligence is enough to make an impact and forgets that trust is the real currency in both healthcare and education.

Doctors don’t just prescribe, they hold your hand during a cancer diagnosis. Teachers don’t just deliver content but they spot the kid falling behind, build confidence, and unlock potential. AI can assist, but it can’t replace human empathy and trust.

So is AI important? Absolutely.
AI can read scans better than most radiologists. It can solve for homework & personalise lessons faster than a teacher. It can democratize access to world class knowledge, in any language, at near zero cost.

But can it replace the human relationship that sits at the core of these professions? AI doesn’t replace doctors. It replaces inefficiencies around them. Likewise AI won’t replace teachers. But it can free them from admin so they can actually teach

Tech is best when it’s invisible. When it supports human work & not erase it.

Every week a news article or investor confidently declares that tech will fix healthcare & most entrepreneurs fall for this illusion of disruption. This narrative is doing more harm than good.

Most entrepreneurs today think, if we can build a beautifully designed app, use AI to chat, automate doctor-patient interactions, and scale it to millions of users, we can ""solve"" healthcare. 

It sounds great in a pitch deck. It almost never works in reality.

Why? Because healthcare isn't e-commerce. You can’t scale a hospital bed like a food delivery fleet. You can’t disrupt chronic disease with a better UI. You can’t solve trust with a chatbot. Healthcare isn’t a transaction, it’s a relationship.

If you're serious about fixing healthcare, start thinking from first principles.

Everyone wants to build the “Uber of Healthcare.” But Uber works because a ride from point A to B is a simple transaction. Healthcare isn’t. You can’t just match a patient with a doctor and assume the job is done. Don't build a generic doctor consultation app with a new UI or a marketplace that lists thousand doctor names. Focus on depth of care, outcomes, and follow-up treatments before chasing millions of users. Build a connected system that only focuses on driving outcomes.

Don't over focus on AI without fixing the basics. AI can help a doctor diagnose faster. But it can’t replace the doctor. Yet, doctors alone won’t solve India’s healthcare crisis. They also need trained frontline workers assisted by smart tech. Build AI tools to assist doctors enable faster diagnoses. Don't oversell your AI engine or LLM models to a patient. 

It doesn’t matter if we have the best doctor or AI engine if the right medicine isn’t available. Up to 20% of medicines sold in India are fake or substandard. Counterfeit drugs are a massive problem & the Pharma companies are growing this $58 billion market. Perhaps a great usecase to use AI and tech to streamline the supply chain. 

So, can tech fix healthcare? Yes. 
But not by replacing doctors, hospitals, or traditional care systems. The biggest healthcare opportunities in India are not about disruption but augmentation.

The reality is brutal—less than 1% of aspiring athletes make it big, and even those who do are left with little security once their careers are over. Sports, like startups, have a power law distribution—10% of players make 90% of the money. Everyone else is a statistic.

We love to read and watch the underdog story—the kid from nowhere who makes it to the top. But that’s survivorship bias. For every one success, there are tens of thousands who trained just as hard but got nothing. The real question is: why does sports have to be a gamble?

 If you’re not in the top 1%, you don’t get sponsorships, you don’t have financial security, and once your career ends—usually in your late 20’s or early 30s—you’re left scrambling for what’s next.

In developed nations, sports is a structured industry. There are leagues, second-tier careers, college scholarships, and post-career pathways. 

If you don’t become an Olympic champion, you can still earn a living as a coach, analyst, trainer, or minor league player. The system doesn’t discard you the moment you’re not in the top 1%.

The problem isn’t that sports is hard—it’s that failure is absolute. An engineer who fails at a startup can get a job. A failed athlete? They often have nothing. That’s why in most countries without strong sports ecosystems, success in sports correlates with wealth. You can’t afford to be an athlete unless you can afford to lose.

Right now, telling a poor kid to pursue sports is like telling them to buy lottery tickets as an investment strategy. Until we change that, Gopi’s words will remain true. And that’s a failure—not of the athletes, but of the system.

A great sports system doesn’t just create champions—it creates a nation of resilient, disciplined, and competitive people. And that’s the foundation of real development.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dilipevs_gopi-is-right-the-reality-is-brutalless-activity-7298932594161725441-N31J?utm_source=social_share_send&utm_medium=member_desktop_web&rcm=ACoAAGEeiloBmkZ8ZCccA8Ma0SR3CJTUPo9wcrA,Dilip Kumar,gopi is right the reality is brutalless than of aspiring athletes make it big and even those who do are left with little security once their careers are over sports like startups have a power law distribution of players make of the money everyone else is a statistic we love to read and watch the underdog storythe kid from nowhere who makes it to the top but thats survivorship bias for every one success there are tens of thousands who trained just as hard but got nothing the real question is why does sports have to be a gamble if youre not in the top you dont get sponsorships you dont have financial security and once your career endsusually in your late s or early syoure left scrambling for whats next in developed nations sports is a structured industry there are leagues secondtier careers college scholarships and postcareer pathways if you dont become an olympic champion you can still earn a living as a coach analyst trainer or minor league player the system doesnt discard you the moment youre not in the top the problem isnt that sports is hardits that failure is absolute an engineer who fails at a startup can get a job a failed athlete they often have nothing thats why in most countries without strong sports ecosystems success in sports correlates with wealth you cant afford to be an athlete unless you can afford to lose right now telling a poor kid to pursue sports is like telling them to buy lottery tickets as an investment strategy until we change that gopis words will remain true and thats a failurenot of the athletes but of the system a great sports system doesnt just create championsit creates a nation of resilient disciplined and competitive people and thats the foundation of real development,0.095,0.753,0.153,0.9601,Positive

No one tells you this upfront. I learned it the hard way, first as a founder, now as an investor.

You’ve chosen the harder game. Not because prevention doesn’t work, but because people don’t pay for it. Most wake up thinking about chai, parathas , deadlines, and school fees. Not long-term health. People today want instant gratification—sugar today, gym tomorrow.

Curative health makes money because illness is urgent. No one postpones a bypass surgery or negotiates an ICU bill. But prevention? Everyone hunts for gym discounts, coupon codes for healthy food and thinks twice before paying for a fitness program.

Hospitals & pharma companies thrive because they sell relief from suffering. And suffering is a guaranteed market—prevention is not.

That’s why venture money chases curative health—it scales fast with clear unit economics, solving problems people can’t ignore. Asking someone to eat better, sleep more, and exercise for a payoff 5–10 years later is like selling an FD over a lottery ticket. So accept this reality and build accordingly.

Yet, prevention is the hardest problem and the biggest untaped opportunity.
#1 Healthcare in India will shift to prevention-not because people suddenly care, but because not caring is becoming too expensive. 

#2 Your market isn’t TAM, it’s WTM (willing-to-pay market). Everyone should care about health, but few will pay for it.To go mass-market, make it cheaper than chai and as seamless as WhatsApp.

#3 If you’re selling prevention, reposition it. People don’t buy prevention. They buy status, performance, and convenience. Make it aspirational & competitive.

#4 Trust in health isn’t built overnight. People won’t change their habits because you raised venture money. You’re in the business of delayed gratification. That means slow &sustainable growth.

#5 If your product doesn’t make people healthier or keep them engaged long-term, the number of app downloads doesn't matter. Focus on retention, real outcomes and revenue—not GMV, DAUs or metrics to make a pitch deck look good. 

If you can do this, you won’t just build a business—you’ll change how India thinks about health.

These are my general observations of the sector in 2024 so far. An investor & health enthusiast perspective. 

Remember, these are observations and not opinions.  If you’re a builder, I'm always keen to exchange notes.

1) Health tech needs maturing – The novelty phase of tech meets health is over and the focus should be on driving outcomes to the user.

2) Preventive health is gaining traction – More startups are focused on preventive solutions.

3) Nutrition personalisation is heating up – Companies are going beyond generic consulting and leveraging DNA, microbiome, or other personal data for nutrition recommendations.

4) UPI for health not yet in India- ABDM use cases haven't seen much adoption.

5) Wearables are no longer the star – Smartwatches and rings are still strong but are considered table stakes. Consumers want something that tells “why” and not limited to “what”.

6) Corporate wellness is an overrated market – With rising mental health issues, stress, and burnout in the workforce, B2B wellness solutions ideally should show promise. But there isn’t adoption from corporates.

7) The “biohacking” trend is niche but growing –longevity startups are speculative but hot.  Increasing interest in biohacking protocols (sleep optimization, anti ageing etc.). But the market is niche and often hard to validate scientifically unless clinical protocols are done.

8) Consumer trust in health supplements is dwindling – The supplement industry lacks regulation and transparency and this has eroded trust amongst consumers. Brands are focusing on science-backed products.

9) AI in healthcare – Many are bullish on AI’s potential to revolutionise diagnostics, patient care, and drug discovery, but deployment in clinical settings is slow and capital-intensive.

10) Mental health is booming – Digital mental health startups, especially those offering therapy, coaching, or CBT solutions are seeing adoptions but differentiation is becoming a challenge in a crowded market.

11) Community-driven fitness – Social, community-oriented fitness solutions still have potential if done right especially those blending real-world interactions with digital offerings.

12) CAC is a challenge for D2C health brands – Brands are facing rising customer acquisition costs often with no sustainable GTM.

13) Hybrid health businesses are scaling better – Companies combining digital and physical services have better scope of scaling fast.

14) Telehealth plateaued – The initial excitement around telehealth has subsided for both consumers and investors.

15) Health marketplaces have no moat – Platforms connecting consumers with healthcare providers or wellness services are overrated with no clear moat to grow.

Did an impromptu Health Founders meet-up in Delhi last Friday. 180+ people signed up. Could only admit 40 due to space limitations. All of them showed up and few brought their co-founders along.

I thought events and meet-ups were in abundance. Maybe 5-10 people will turn up. But 50 founders were hanging out for 4 hrs on a Friday evening. And all passionate about health and building products to make Indians healthy. 

There was no speech, no panel, no agenda. 
But entrepreneurs have an innate ability to communicate. So they all started talking to each other. Figured that networking is overrated. But a space to have unfiltered conversations and be your authentic is underrated. 

Some got new customers.
Some met their customers who were using their products. 
Some got offer to share the office space.
Some validated their new product ideas.
Some established new partnerships. 
Lot of questions on why, what and how. 
And a few made their funding pitch. Founder preamble you know :) 
There was learning and a some unlearning. 

Apologies for people we couldn’t admit. There was a genuine space limitation. 
It was an experiment and i dint expect this much response.

But no is telling WHY it's happening.

In this podcast we discussed 
- Early years in Badminton and the pursuit to become a champion player 
- How parents can play a role in creating future olympians.

This may disappoint a few.

First, if you are a founder building in the health. You've to walk the talk. 
What does that mean? You have to be healthy and fit. 

-The biggest moat in the health industry is trust. This can't be built by performance marketing or hiring influencers. 
-Why will a customer trust your product if the founder isn't healthy? You don't need six packs. But you shouldn't look unfit.
-If your product came out from your own problem statement, great. Tell the world how you got there and share your experience. 
-In health industry you scale by not selling features. But by earning the trust. 

Second, don't pitch or raise money from an investor who doesn't walk the talk. 

-To build a scalable business TAM is important. But impact is most important.
- If the first question they ask is, how large is the business and not why you choose to build the product. That's a sign.
- If an investor doesn't make an effort to experience your product or service and offer genuine feedback. They are truly not investing in you. But chasing vanity.
- Have seen many VC events ending with alcohol and the food corner filled with junk. And that happens because they don't walk the talk and perhaps staying healthy is not their top priority in personal life.

Missing good investments is the occupational hazard of venture capitalists.
One of the biggest learning in the past year after talking to 200+ founders is , investors can never estimate the insight a founder has to the problem statement they are solving for. A phone call or a coffee meeting will never be enough. 

Founder's superpower is the ability to understand user problems and build solutions that customers may not even ask for. And investors should let curiosity anchor the conversations than making conclusions based on reports or industry thesis. You may still not get it. That's fine.

That’s Nithin, Vishnu & me crossing the finish line at IronMan Goa last month.
We participated as a corporate relay team. 

Working in a 9am-6pm work environment can be stressful. Be it corporates or startups. Employers want their teams to be healthy. And employees want to live a healthy life. 
The mismatch is in expectations.

Most employers over complicate employee wellness by pushing for programs that don't sync with everyone. But sometimes the biggest impact is driven by doing simple things. 

At Zerodha & Rainmatter playing sports is an anchor that has worked well.
Not just evangelising it but participation from top leadership to everyone in the company.

The upside is, now we have more folks doing events for running, triathlons, obstacle racing and more. There are groups playing some sport every weekend. And all this without any complicated employee wellness program.

We discuss the founding story , how they got the first 100 participants for their first race, the near closure of the company and how the team revived and scaled back post pandemic, the unknowns of sports business in India, transition from a physical experience product to a platform company. And the new stuff they are building to redefinine fitness entertainment.

In this podcast we unpack her other side:
- Her journey from a college athlete to corporate boardroom.
- Revisiting her passion for sports & fitness after becoming a mother of two toddlers.
- Chasing peak athletic pursuits in her 50's.
- Balancing training between family & professional commitments.
- Experiences of running some of the toughest races in the world.
- Toolkit to overcome challenges faced by women in corporate & sports.

They look far and hazy unless you keep chasing them. 
Every day, every week, every month.


In 2020, I set a goal to run a Sub 3hr marathon. 
For 4months, I was chasing this goal. It was up on my wall 😊 
To become Sub 3 marathoner.

And every week, I got two inch closer.

I’ll wake up and stare at the wall reminiscing all the past training and before going to bed muster whatever left for the next day.

Marathon training is just learning to be bored while you're hurting. 

Did i meet my goal? ...Yes, I finished 2:59:52 😌 
But those 16 weeks changed me a lot.
as an entrepreneur,
as a colleague,
as a husband,
as a friend,
and as an athlete.

There are maybe 100 men in India who can run Sub3hr marathon.
I'm one of them.
Today a 2:55:58 Marathoner.
Head high, heart full.

Everyone teaches motivation. But no one learns discipline.
Motivation is in abundance. Discipline is scarce. 

The progress in your goals is the gap between your desire and commitment.

I hope our conversation is useful in some way. 

Please remember, becoming unhealthy is not an event. It is a process. Like a plane crash, becoming unhealthy is rarely caused by one thing going wrong. Usually, it is a series of ignorance— lack of physical exercise, compromising on sleep, food choices & stress.  All these will interact and then compound. I realised the process late in my life though. 

It's very rare to meet people who are driven by genuine curiosity and passion to learn a new skill. Priyanka is one of them.

You should watch the full episode to understand why every entrepreneur should also be a sports person. All the guest i spoke with on my podcast have this common trait of playing some sport. Why?

Ofcourse you gain fitness.

But there are benefits beyond that. What are they?

- Develops a mindset to deal with pressure and competition. 
- Builds mental models for proactive thinking and problem solving. 
- Learning from injuries will prepare you to handle failures. 
- Builds mental toughness. Every game starts with zero. 
- Teamwork. Giving up the ‘Me’ for the ‘We’.
- Sometimes playing defense can be a superpower. 
- Everyone has a shelf life. Nithin calls it the ‘energy efficiency’
