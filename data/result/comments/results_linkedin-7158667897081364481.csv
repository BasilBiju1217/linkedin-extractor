Aseem Aggarwal,https://www.linkedin.com/in/aseemaggarwal,Founder at Skyway | Solving the great Indian health crisis,"The insights on resting heart rate are intriguing. I've also found the resting respiratory rate (number of breaths per minute) to be an interesting number. Humans, with a rate of 12-20 breaths/min, enjoy a lifespan of 70-80 years. Dogs, at a swift 30 breaths/min, average 10-15 years. Turtles, with a slow 1-10 breaths/min, boast a century-plus lifespan.

This interplay between physiology and lifespan is super fascinating. If truly our heartbeats and breaths are limited, then athletic performance & meditation go a long way to help increase our lifespan. I believe there is tremendous power in slowing down your resting heart rate and respiratory rate.",2024-02-01T04:39:21.612Z,"urn:li:comment:(ugcPost:7158667897081364481,7158680200354902017)",7f7c95ad34b6c8a67be3a8f58252cce8b2ea73112d39049a2e88380f70b438f6,urn:li:ugcPost:7158667897081364481,cf9e8be893d4985b6185e1bb3ed4f123af137aa8fa0419464ae61eea68191666,7158667897081364481,the insights on resting heart rate are intriguing ive also found the resting respiratory rate number of breaths per minute to be an interesting number humans with a rate of breathsmin enjoy a lifespan of years dogs at a swift breathsmin average years turtles with a slow breathsmin boast a centuryplus lifespan this interplay between physiology and lifespan is super fascinating if truly our heartbeats and breaths are limited then athletic performance meditation go a long way to help increase our lifespan i believe there is tremendous power in slowing down your resting heart rate and respiratory rate,0.018,0.744,0.238,0.967,Positive
