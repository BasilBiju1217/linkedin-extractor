GV Multiservices LLP,,69 followers,"Valid point!

While mental and physical well-being should be important, and youth should prioritize it, you will always find that the youths who look for this are from financially stable backgrounds with parents to fall back to! The other half of youths who had to work harder to reach this point, with modest to low-income backgrounds, and with family responsibilities have to have a continuous flow of income and cannot afford to find and choose working conditions on one’s own choices. To attain the “wealthiness” you mention, some youths generally reach the freedom after 30s which is not wrong but just fact.

Most MNCs have sales persons in foreign countries who pitch and sell Indian workforce as cheap labours who can work more hours.
