Your message reflects an important and inspiring perspective. 

Encouraging and supporting athletes in their journey, both in success and in times of struggle, is essential to building a robust sports culture in India. 

It's true that consistent support, not just financially but emotionally, can make a huge difference in athletes' lives. 

By recognizing and celebrating even the smaller milestones, we can create a strong ecosystem that fosters growth, resilience, and determination.

Your partnership with GoSports Foundation is a significant step in the right direction. 

Supporting organizations that focus on athlete development and creating long-term frameworks for their success can truly help India rise on the global sports stage. 

It's wonderful to see initiatives like Rainmatter by Zerodha contributing to this cause, and this collective effort will certainly help future athletes make the nation proud.

Cheering for Indian athletes in every step, whether they win or lose, will build a more inclusive and passionate sports community, and seeing the Indian flag shine globally brings immense pride to the country. 

Keep up the excellent work in pushing this forward!",2024-09-13T09:24:45.265Z,"urn:li:comment:(ugcPost:7240276642466521088,7240289291921203200)",055f4ac7449eea6479a2407722e19c8b718bfa1c0b45840baaa4ddac5c4d232e,urn:li:ugcPost:7240276642466521088,4796032133663f5149a65efa554604a8942691d85094735c625e2cf720aa2ed1,7240276642466521088,dilip kumar your message reflects an important and inspiring perspective encouraging and supporting athletes in their journey both in success and in times of struggle is essential to building a robust sports culture in india its true that consistent support not just financially but emotionally can make a huge difference in athletes lives by recognizing and celebrating even the smaller milestones we can create a strong ecosystem that fosters growth resilience and determination your partnership with gosports foundation is a significant step in the right direction supporting organizations that focus on athlete development and creating longterm frameworks for their success can truly help india rise on the global sports stage its wonderful to see initiatives like rainmatter by zerodha contributing to this cause and this collective effort will certainly help future athletes make the nation proud cheering for indian athletes in every step whether they win or lose will build a more inclusive and passionate sports community and seeing the indian flag shine globally brings immense pride to the country keep up the excellent work in pushing this forward,0.021,0.573,0.406,0.9983,Positive
