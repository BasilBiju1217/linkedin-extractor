There are enough people who will vouch for intermittent fasting - whereas there will be others who will vouch for not fasting, and eating small meals multiple times a day.

There are people who will say don’t eat X, and others who will say, eat only X! And no matter what X is, you will find someone to fight for it!

And there are some, like Warren Buffet who eat burgers and drink Coke - and are fully fit at 90!

For such an important topic, something that impacts everyone, the level of confusion you see, is simply mind boggling!
