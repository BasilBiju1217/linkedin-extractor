India's quantum computing initiative (₹6,000+ crore National Quantum Mission) and defense-tech ecosystem are perfect examples of where we need to build indigenous capabilities now.

Post-quantum cryptography (critical for fintech like Zerodha) 
AI-powered defense systems with dual civilian applications
Indigenous semiconductor and quantum hardware capabilities
