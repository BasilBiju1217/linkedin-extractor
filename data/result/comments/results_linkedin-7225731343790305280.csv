Neha Chauhan,https://www.linkedin.com/in/neha-chauhan-ba308327,Sports Management Professional,"The Indian sports industry is still lagging behind, not due to a lack of investment in our elite athletes, but because of deficiencies in research and development, applied sports sciences, and the availability of top-notch, homegrown technical support staff. We remain overly reliant on Western coaches in most Olympic sports, which hinders the development of indigenous expertise.

At the grassroots level, the situation is even more concerning. The basic facilities necessary for nurturing future athletes are insufficient, and there has been a lack of comprehensive studies to address this. Rather than spreading resources thinly across all sports in every state, a more strategic approach is needed. We should focus on identifying which sports have the most potential in specific states and concentrate our resources there. This would involve targeted investment in states that naturally produce talent in particular sports, rather than wasting funds in regions where there is little interest or potential.",2024-08-09T03:21:33.858Z,"urn:li:comment:(ugcPost:7225731343790305280,7227514316839665664)",51c1f2fded653b0b9b419a9c7aa3c16f1e29dd35222bffba8142aeb7155919ab,urn:li:ugcPost:7225731343790305280,f378613b82bf33e37c74e0e6831d29192e6a992263378d4f5fe498e77ef488f0,7225731343790305280,the indian sports industry is still lagging behind not due to a lack of investment in our elite athletes but because of deficiencies in research and development applied sports sciences and the availability of topnotch homegrown technical support staff we remain overly reliant on western coaches in most olympic sports which hinders the development of indigenous expertise at the grassroots level the situation is even more concerning the basic facilities necessary for nurturing future athletes are insufficient and there has been a lack of comprehensive studies to address this rather than spreading resources thinly across all sports in every state a more strategic approach is needed we should focus on identifying which sports have the most potential in specific states and concentrate our resources there this would involve targeted investment in states that naturally produce talent in particular sports rather than wasting funds in regions where there is little interest or potential,0.031,0.832,0.138,0.9508,Positive

Personally, I believe, a (large) part of the problem lies in the cultural mindset when it comes to pushing limits.

The primary problem is very much still a question of priorities and choices when it comes to sports vs academics and this requires a major change in parent’ mindsets.

But, while the government and corporates can do a lot to improve infrastructure and standards, I don’t think it’s going to change if we simply depend on institutions to help solve the lack of success.

There is a tendency for people to make general excuses such as genetics, diet, weather, poverty, infrastructure etc etc for why we don’t have more success. 

For each one of the above, there is a country or athlete that will have proven otherwise. 

Having coached kids in a sport, I have seen plenty of “talent” gone to waste either from a change in priorities or from excuses mentioned above.

Happy to have a private chat Dilip Kumar about some of the issues, I believe, keep us from having more success in sports…and not just the Olympics.",2024-08-04T16:30:14.456Z,"urn:li:comment:(ugcPost:7225731343790305280,7225900854485147648)",f8891b21a0c60efa18c072da4d425e40fb0562a518c47f71cc586c6e5fda6288,urn:li:ugcPost:7225731343790305280,f378613b82bf33e37c74e0e6831d29192e6a992263378d4f5fe498e77ef488f0,7225731343790305280,great listen dilip kumar with a lot of good points made personally i believe a large part of the problem lies in the cultural mindset when it comes to pushing limits the primary problem is very much still a question of priorities and choices when it comes to sports vs academics and this requires a major change in parent mindsets but while the government and corporates can do a lot to improve infrastructure and standards i dont think its going to change if we simply depend on institutions to help solve the lack of success there is a tendency for people to make general excuses such as genetics diet weather poverty infrastructure etc etc for why we dont have more success for each one of the above there is a country or athlete that will have proven otherwise having coached kids in a sport i have seen plenty of talent gone to waste either from a change in priorities or from excuses mentioned above happy to have a private chat dilip kumar about some of the issues i believe keep us from having more success in sportsand not just the olympics,0.077,0.746,0.176,0.9758,Positive
