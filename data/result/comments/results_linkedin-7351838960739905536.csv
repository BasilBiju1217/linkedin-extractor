And our outcomes are

1) healthcare is 24*7 job so don't go for zepto or blinkit kind of approach of morning to night, it will dilute the purpose,

2) the thing one need in or below 10 mins is primary care or emergency care, when you need dressing or injection support for stone pain/dog bite you need it immediately. In case of emergency you just need right support before ambulance arrives

3) for any preventive need you need quality and right guidance and not the speed,

4) for doctor consultation physical delivery is all times not possible or practically possible, but you need right technology to have right doctor support

5) technology is enabler here and not the core because AI will not give injection or do dressing, you need quality people, but yes good technology or AI will smoothen the processes,

6) healthcare support is a combination of speed and quality plus personal touch, so everything is in 10 mins is practically a bad idea...

Sahil Choudhary,https://www.linkedin.com/in/sahilpedazo,Building Ru’ya- a Multi-Technology Single Pane of Glass platform for IT Operations,"Few of my observations:

1. Medicine Delivery has active players, but profitability is a myth. The SKU mix is complex, and full prescriptions are rarely available. If customers still need to step out to complete their purchase, the convenience breaks down.

2. Scheduled Drugs need prescriptions, but there’s no real gatekeeping. Anyone can upload a prescription, there’s little to no verification (last I used). In theory, even a kid could order sleeping pills. Plus, some essential drugs aren’t deliverable, adding more friction.

3. Online doctor consults are broken. Diagnosis quality is hit or miss. Often, it’s junior doctors and patients spam chats, making it impossible to justify doctor costs. It just becomes unsustainable.

4. Healthcare is inherently trust-based. When people are spending money on health, they choose trust not the apps. That's why hospitals and local practitioners still win.

Zet Abhishek,https://www.linkedin.com/in/zetabhishek,Founder at Zet Health | IIM Bangalore,"Insightful post, Dilip — and yes, “10-min healthcare” makes for a killer pitch headline.
 
Though honestly, if you're seeing 10 startups a week doing this, do share — we've been building in this space and can barely count half that with any real traction.
- Let’s not forget — no one “needed” 10-min groceries either, until suddenly bananas became more urgent than broadband.

- Urban consumption has a way of turning absurdities into expectations.

- True, 90% of healthcare doesn’t need speed. But for the 10% that does — emergency meds, critical blood tests, or that dreaded 7AM fasting sample — speed becomes habit-forming convenience.

-At Zet Health, we’ve learned that trust is the baseline, not a differentiator. But speed isn’t evil — it just needs solid infra: trained staff, reliable logistics, and clinical protocols.

-So before we throw speed-focused healthcare under the ambulance, let’s remember — 10% of lives improved is still impact.

 Trust matters.
 Speed helps.

	• Healthcare isn’t about speed.
	• It’s about trust, consistency, and context.

Points that really landed with me:
→ Discovery > Delivery.
→ Quality > Quantity.
→ Infra & people ops > vanity timelines.

Also, most people confuse convenience with care.
Your local chemist, nurse, and lab technician already solve 80% of what these 10-min apps are chasing — just not in VC-friendly slides.

Question worth asking:
Are we solving healthcare problems or investor pitch problems?

Through my experience, I've learned that people don't want fast healthcare instead, they want accessible healthcare that actually works.

I've watched people chase quick fixes for months, only to find lasting change when they commit to longer-term relationships with practitioners who understand their patterns.

The real gaps I see:
-Finding the right practitioner, not just any available one
-Building trust over time, not rushing consultations
-Integrating mind-body approaches that require patience
-Creating continuity of care, not episodic band-aids

Speed optimizes for convenience. Healthcare optimizes for outcomes. The best healing happens when someone feels truly seen and understood - that takes time, not technology.

Ashutossh D.,https://www.linkedin.com/in/zetashutosh,Building Zet Health - India's first 10-min healthcare platform,"Speed, when paired with expertise and trust, is a winning formula, especially in healthcare. We at Zet Health are building the same.  

In diagnostics, timing matters. A phlebotomist isn’t just delivering a service; they enter your home, perform a skilled and precise procedure, ensure you are at ease, and transport the samples to the lab within the required time window.

That’s what makes healthcare delivery fundamentally different from any other form of quick commerce.

There are genuine clinical scenarios like Arterial Blood Gas tests  where 10-minute collections are not a luxury, but a necessity.

When the quality, price, and trust remain consistent, but one option delivers faster the choice is clear. Consumers are evolving, and so are their expectations. Quick commerce is the new normal !
