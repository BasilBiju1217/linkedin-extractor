The loss of a newborn is heartbreaking, and even more so when we know so many of these deaths are preventable.
That’s exactly where startups like Janitri and Spotsense are stepping in with purpose and precision.
Janitri is reimagining maternal and fetal care through affordable, AI-powered monitoring tools that work in both rural and urban setups. Their wearable devices and dashboards are helping frontline workers detect early warning signs in pregnancies—pre-eclampsia, fetal distress, delayed labor—before they turn fatal.
SpotSense is another game-changer. They’re building low-cost, point-of-care diagnostics for neonatal sepsis—one of the biggest killers in the first few weeks of life. Using saliva-based biosensors, they’re detecting infections faster than conventional blood culture systems.

You're absolutely right about the AI potential in healthcare, and I think the scope is even broader than the 2.5% post-birth mortality you mentioned.

The real challenge has been implementation and providing quality care in a public healthcare system setting. This is the case even when the newborns are already identified. Data is often altered/missed to avoid admitting these newborns, to drive the hospital mortality rate down. 

There are proven solutions based on decades of research, but they are just not implemented well. Ansh is working on it. 

Early diagnosis of newborn sepsis is missing. But then the challenge is low-cost market expectation leaving less incentive to heavily invest in research. An advance market commitment might solve this though.

Dr Sudip Chowdhury,https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-sudip-chowdhury-b69a8818,Senior Consultant @ Fortis Healthcare | Medical Research | Quality improvement | Healthcare Leadership,"Neonatal mortality remains significantly higher in rural India (~1.5x urban). While national rates have dropped to ~25/1,000 live births (2021 numbers). The urban numbers are not that drastic, but still alarming. It also shows variations in states etc, like in urban karnataka it is 8/1000. Neonatal deaths occur many times due to sepsis which is preventable by rigorous hygeine at hospital and home. While the urban areas have better private sector hospitals, rural areas mainly depend on government infrastructure which is deplorable in many states. Many NGOs are working on this part, teaching hygeine to parents and working on best practices in hospitals. Predictive power of death from sepsis in Neonates are high with guidelines available which doctors are aware of. 
So, I believe that neonatal mortality can be better prevented from best practices and pure hygeine , handwashing rather than AI models. More than that, the real place of need is rural india where penetration of basic technology is pretty low.

The numbers are painful, but what’s worse is how avoidable many of these tragedies are. When 60% of infant deaths are preventable, it’s not just a statistic — it’s a call to action.

AI has real potential here: not to replace care, but to extend its reach — especially in areas where infrastructure is thin. From early risk stratification to remote diagnostics, the tech already exists. What’s missing is deployment at scale, and the will to prioritize it.

There’s so much talent in India’s healthtech space.

Having spent the last 20 years evaluating innovations, patents, and emerging tech (large part of my work has been in health tech), I can say that predictive models, AI diagnostics, remote monitoring, and historical health data modeling do have great potential to improve outcomes. But I think the biggest challenges are not due to the absence of such technologies particularly in Indian context. In fact, in many cases the risk is already known to doctors, to health workers, sometimes even to the family. Yet the tragedy still unfolds. Because of gaps in awareness, social and behavioral factors, resource limitations, infrastructure constraints, and lack of action for some other reasons. These are systemic, not technological, barriers. That said, technology must still be built, and smartly.
