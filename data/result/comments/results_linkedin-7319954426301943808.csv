Ronit Saha,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ronit-saha,"Category Management & Procurement | Driving Efficiency in Retail, E-Commerce & FMCG","AI can significantly enhance diagnostic accuracy, speed, and efficiency by analyzing complex data, identifying subtle anomalies in imaging, and even suggesting personalized treatment plans. This can reduce the workload of healthcare professionals, especially by automating routine or redundant tasks and streamlining processes.

However, the adoption of AI depends heavily on doctors’ willingness to embrace new technology. Studies show that some physicians resist AI recommendations, especially when they conflict with their own judgment, often due to training gaps or concerns about professional credibility. This resistance can stem from traditional roles, perceived threats to expertise, or discomfort when patients arrive well-informed or with their own research.

Ultimately, for AI to reach its full potential in healthcare, there needs to be a cultural shift: doctors must be open to collaboration with AI, view it as a tool to augment rather than replace their expertise, and receive proper training to integrate AI insights into clinical decision-making. This partnership can lead to better patient outcomes and more human-centered care, provided both technology and mindsets evolve together.",2025-04-23T04:28:31.840Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7319954426301943808,7320664850940985344)",5111e5b90fec0a11a39b3c1e5678b9f0fb3134554c7f50b79c17238441140ba4,urn:li:activity:7319954426301943808,da4559dca9b1fdb07a8adc266497ddc6483a75571c061b479e0dc53632b7a8b0,7319954426301943808,ai can significantly enhance diagnostic accuracy speed and efficiency by analyzing complex data identifying subtle anomalies in imaging and even suggesting personalized treatment plans this can reduce the workload of healthcare professionals especially by automating routine or redundant tasks and streamlining processes however the adoption of ai depends heavily on doctors willingness to embrace new technology studies show that some physicians resist ai recommendations especially when they conflict with their own judgment often due to training gaps or concerns about professional credibility this resistance can stem from traditional roles perceived threats to expertise or discomfort when patients arrive wellinformed or with their own research ultimately for ai to reach its full potential in healthcare there needs to be a cultural shift doctors must be open to collaboration with ai view it as a tool to augment rather than replace their expertise and receive proper training to integrate ai insights into clinical decisionmaking this partnership can lead to better patient outcomes and more humancentered care provided both technology and mindsets evolve together,0.045,0.877,0.079,0.6387,Positive
