I was recently discussing with my co-founder (based in the US) how differently things function at a systems level — the way structure, risk, and innovation are approached is fundamentally different from what we see here.

Arshal Jain,https://www.linkedin.com/in/arshaljain,Engineering @ Salesforce,"I agree with everything you said, but I think we need to look beyond just the lack of a strong narrative. Saying India's main problem is storytelling or marketing feels like we're missing the real issue — which is focus.

A lot of the well-known “dropout founders” from Harvard or Stanford got into those colleges just to drop out and use the brand name to raise money. Their businesses often aim for quick profits by serving mass markets — not real innovation. In India, we’ve copied the outer layer of that model — the hype, fast growth, and name-dropping — but without the systems or culture to support it.

Many of India’s biggest startups aren't led by founders trying to solve real problems. They're more focused on PR and attention than on building long-term solutions. That’s why we got 10-minute grocery delivery before we fixed Bengaluru’s traffic, Delhi’s air pollution, or the lack of affordable housing in crowded cities.

If you look at the data from some of YC's batches, more than 50% of the companies originate from outside the U.S.

          Take a look at the stats from the YC Summer 2021 batch:

                    377 companies across 47 countries, representing over 4 billion people worldwide.
                    About 50% of the companies were based outside the U.S.. Top countries, excluding the U.S., included:
                    India (33)
                    UK (18)
                    Mexico (17)
                    Canada (18)
                    Brazil (11)
                    Singapore (12)

         These numbers demonstrate the growing global appeal and the increasing talent coming from non-U.S. countries. With India's thriving startup ecosystem and an abundance of entrepreneurial talent, there’s definitely potential to create a YC-like model right here.
