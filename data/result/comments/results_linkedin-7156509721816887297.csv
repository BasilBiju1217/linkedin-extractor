Firstly hearty congratulations 🎊 to Rohan Bopanna for this fantastic achievement. We need such milestones to inspire the next generation to make sports a lucrative career. 

My standing ovation to Rohan Bopanna and all the folks behind his commitment , grit and determination to reach this goal.


A billion population and what's our global achievement in other sports, world events ex.Fifa etc. nil for the past 75 years. 

What does it take to do good - the list is long...but do we really want to achieve or scale greatest in sports ?

 I doubt looking at the parody in sports governing bodies ( no offence intended)

We need to mature our thought process to excel ...that I don't foresee in our times atleast...
