Prasad Mangipudi,https://www.linkedin.com/in/pmangipudi,Sports IPR expert- MD- Sportzprix,"Our company launched the Premier Badminton League, which we managed for five years until the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite featuring talented players like PV Sindhu, Saina Nehwal, Kidambi Srikanth, Lakshya Sen, Satwik-Chirag, and others, we struggled to attract big-name supporters. Some celebrities, including Akshay Kumar and SRT who initially backed the league, eventually exited. We also reached out to another legend multiple times, but he only made a brief appearance in Season 5 without promoting the league.

Every season, we invited the Union Sports Minister to attend the inaugural match or finals, but he never attended. Even India's historic Thomas Cup win in 2022 didn't translate to increased support for badminton. Despite brainstorming with legendary coach Pullela Gopichand, we couldn't raise the sport's profile as we'd hoped. Although participation in the game increased significantly during this period, we ultimately couldn't achieve our goals and had to discontinue the league.
