Shakthi Sairam,https://www.linkedin.com/in/shakthisairamtech,Building a bionic arm for India @Symbionic,"Taking this train of thought a step further, I feel like the interpretation of the data and research involved wrt improvement in fitness causes a lot of friction for people pursuing any fitness goal. 

Along with the HOW biomarkers are changing and WHY they are, if there was a way to continously suggest areas of improvement and tactics from personalized data collection, it would remove a great deal of friction from the process and possibly increase adherence.  

I believe this is done on a case by case basis by personal trainers and nutritionists now, but could be done on a larger scale with the right methods to collect the personalized data. (Mostly because finding good nutrionists and personal trainers who are trustworthy is hard, which I exactly what believe Fittr is solving)

Knowing almost everything you are doing everyday and everything happening everyday with you.

There should be an AI chip implanted in the brain that can analyse the neurological links, process it and send required output to your wearable devices. Or maybe something similar which can tell almost everything about you and feed that data to AI.

However, there is huge gap before wearables could decode. The current wearable tech is nothing but a small pie in disease management opportunity.

 For instance, CGM can tell you spike in blood glucose/blood sugar response/levels. But this does not help until we have info & data on GLUT 4- the protein that goes to cell membrane, bind to glucose, clear it from circulation & transport to cell for storage or energy. Therefore data on molecular signalling that activates GLUT 4 is the key.

Similarly, we may know HRV but unless we decode /measure norepinephrine and epinephrine levels or histamine signalling, HRV is of no use

Bibin Radhakrishnan,https://www.linkedin.com/in/bibinrkoff,Progress not perfection!,"In my experience building an Electronic Health Record(EHR) this is extremely difficult to implement.

Here's why: Root cause diagnosis has to be done by General Medicine doctors and not specialists because only root cause can tell exactly ""Why"" and this is how the process would flow for that:

Chief Complaint/Symptom
Clinical Finding
Differential Diagnosis
Chronic conditions(if any)
Genetic conditions(if any)
Social Behaviours that can cause a condition
Allergies
And Lab Tests to validate

All these factors are necessary to know WHY. Now am assuming that you don't want it to exactly be a 100% but if it's not atleast ""quite accurate"" then the ""Why"" can scare the customer especially since most of the these wearables have a lot of inaccuracies. And having all this data captured by a wearable or otherwise is an expensive affair in my experience.

And most importantly the ""Why"" is difficult even for a doctor to find. That's why it's called a Differential Diagnosis. #myexperience",2024-04-15T06:11:22.855Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7185511912204316672,7185520060180922369)",4dbbd3253edd41cc69c4603e2ed845eef24e7ba7ae138279b552c457f5d903f0,urn:li:activity:7185511912204316672,5f41475e705d2cbb3f181e5b20e81dfc7493bfc57b683c1c169d5b86de790ca3,7185511912204316672,in my experience building an electronic health recordehr this is extremely difficult to implement heres why root cause diagnosis has to be done by general medicine doctors and not specialists because only root cause can tell exactly why and this is how the process would flow for that chief complaintsymptom clinical finding differential diagnosis chronic conditionsif any genetic conditionsif any social behaviours that can cause a condition allergies and lab tests to validate all these factors are necessary to know why now am assuming that you dont want it to exactly be a but if its not atleast quite accurate then the why can scare the customer especially since most of the these wearables have a lot of inaccuracies and having all this data captured by a wearable or otherwise is an expensive affair in my experience and most importantly the why is difficult even for a doctor to find thats why its called a differential diagnosis myexperience,0.068,0.9,0.032,-0.7057,Negative

I've had a chance to think a bit deeply on this (not as much however as I want to!) - and please take this with a grain of salt. 

I think research backed, innovation-led health startups are the future that solve ONE critical thing. Or co-related things. 

Example, there is a company solving for UTI diagnostics, they're created a completely new method for it. Another company is finding absolutely new ways to diagnose breast cancer early on. 

Finding the WHY requires research. Diabetes is still a myth, and I've always thought that businesses building around it should have a content gameplan that increases awareness around their solution.
