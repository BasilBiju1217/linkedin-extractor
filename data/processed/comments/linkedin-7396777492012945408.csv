Vijay Kumar,https://www.linkedin.com/in/vijayparag,Continuous Improvement & Operational Excellence Leader | Factory Operations | TPM | Lean Six Sigma | Procurement Strategy | FMCG & Dairy,"This is a fascinating breakdown, and it actually triggers a question I’ve struggled with for months in the cooperative space.
Amul and many state level cooperatives share the same foundational model on paper, farmer owned, federation structure, district unions, democratic boards. Yet the outcomes are dramatically different. Amul achieves alignment, speed, consistency and system driven execution across all its unions, while others with the same architecture often struggle to maintain even basic uniformity in SOPs, decision making or brand strategy.
What I’ve never fully understood is how Amul manages to keep its governance so clean and its processes so harmonized across such a large network. How do they maintain discipline, prevent internal clashes, keep political noise away from operations, and ensure that “cooperative” doesn’t become an excuse for slow or fragmented decision making?
Would love to understand what cultural or structural guardrails make that kind of consistency possible, because clearly the model is same but the outcomes are worlds apart.",2025-11-20T05:20:36.162Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7396777492012945408,7397141794938916864)",cf4877992a445179b7af4faa98ccbf8c77da3bbcebee8d2a2c66a7e681580dc2,urn:li:activity:7396777492012945408,7d237297cdbad2942a5721907acca68246fa6ad2be4c21dec5655a8a6cafa9f1

Masroor Lodi,https://www.linkedin.com/in/masroorlodi,Founder @ unlock.fit,"Amul is not just a dairy that scaled but a supply-driven powerhouse that turned millions of farmers and thousands of village societies into a nutrition engine. Their 250-product burst makes sense when you realise their cold chain isn’t an enabler, it’s a launchpad. They’ve treated logistics as strategic IP for decades, which is why they can enter any nutrition category almost on demand.
 
What I love most is how every new product—whey, cheese, chocolates, drinks—comes from smart use of surplus milk solids. It’s value creation that genuinely raises farmer income, not just margins. Very few “nutrition brands” can claim that.
 
Their single-brand mass-to-premium strategy is another anomaly. Most companies fragment; Amul lets trust do the heavy lifting across ₹5 to ₹500 SKUs.

If a food based start-up introduces any new product, there are eagle eyes on them to check adoption, quality, YoY growth etc etc etc. We don't see that with the variety of products Amul brings to market. Atleast I haven't.
