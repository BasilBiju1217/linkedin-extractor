  "text": "We are launching something new and very excited about it. A few months ago, I spoke about the need for a large platform that makes health & fitness a part of India’s everyday culture. Since no one built it, we decided to build it ourselves. This pic is from the the meeting where we decided to launch peakst8. \n\nThrough Rainmatter, we’ve supported 40+ companies across health, fitness and sports. One thing has always been clear to us is-India needs a cultural movement around fitness, sports & not just products and apps. So on Jan 10th, in Bangalore, we’re launching Peakst8 Fest. A health & fitness festival India hasn’t seen yet.\n\nThis is for everyone, whether you're fit, unfit, curious, starting again, or just looking for inspiration. We’ll bring together multiple sports formats, fitness workouts, conversations with athletes, experts and people who actually walk the talk around physical and mental health. We want to build this with partners and not alone. If you're a brand or community that believes in this mission, let’s collaborate. See you on Jan 10th and hopefully we get to do a few sessions together 😊",

  "text": "Someone asked advice for engineers & founders to get fit and stay fit while spending 10-12hr/day working on the computer. What one can do is so simple that most will find it hard to follow. \n\n#1 Get out of your home the moment you wake up. Hit the gym, go for a run. Do anything that moves your body. \n\n#2 Don’t touch your phone untill you’re done with #1. Your mind shouldn’t be reacting before your body wakes up. \n\n#3 On days you can’t do the #1, get min 10k steps. Take calls while walking and meetings on the move. Your work always doesn’t need your chair. \n\n#4 Eat as if your life depends on it. Whole foods always first. Don’t make your body a profit center for others. \n\n#5 Sleep like you are paid to do it. No health hack beats 7–8 hours of recovery. \n\nBtw, you can do all the above but if you don’t learn to deal the chaos in your head and bullshit people around you, you’re still going to be unhealthy & unfit. \n\nIgnoring some people for your mental health is not a weakness. It is your superpower.\n\nMost engineers & founders want an optimal protocol. The real value is in the boring things that you’ve to keep doing consistently. Your health is the real moat.",

Most clinics especially in rural areas don’t have specialists or advanced diagnostics.\n\nHis solution, AiSteth, uses AI to screen and detects cardio respiratory disorders early, making high quality diagnosis affordable and accessible to every clinic, even with limited staff or equipment.\n\nWe may not build the next Tesla or AGI  but we have founders who are quietly fixing the hard problems nobody else wants to touch.

  "text": "Amul has evolved from a dairy to a nutrition brand and is probably the most underrated case study in modern day business. They did a revenue of 90,000cr in FY25. Hard to think of another company in the world that has done something similar. Notes on what i think they got right..\n\n1) They innovate at cooperative speed not startup speed and still wins. Launched 250 product launches in 5 years and that's crazy speed for a cooperative with millions of farmers, 18000+ village societies, and government-linked processes. Most companies will shiver at this speed.\n\n2) They turned cold chain into a moat decades before most startups spoke about supply chain tech. They run India’s largest cold supply chain with refrigeration networks across rural area and temperature controlled logistics in small towns. This single capability lets them enter any nutrition category quickly.\n\n3) The nutrition transition feels like farmer driven. More milk production means surplus fat & SNF (casien, whey , lactose) and therefore opportunity to create value added products. Every new category like whey, chocolates, drinks, cheese, creates more value for farmers. Most nutrition brands optimise for margins but they optimise for farmer income.\n\n4) Amul is probably the only brand that simultaneously sells mass and premium products all under same brand,  same dairy and distribution and with same trust. Their products range for Rs 5 to 500. Most brands split into sub brands while Amul let the trust carry everything.\n\nNo obsession with burn, CAC ,CM1/2 growth and branding. They quietly proved that trust, scale and farmer first thinking can still beat everyone.",

  "text": "In the last few weeks, a bunch of companies went IPO and it’s a reminder that entrepreneurship can create enormous wealth for founders and their teams. But it’s also a reminder that most founders will spend years just trying to survive. Thousands are still surviving on belief, debt, delayed and no salaries. I know a few we invested in. And this is what most VCs don’t share. \n\nEntrepreneurship looks glamorous in hindsight but in reality, it’s years of uncertainty, low pay and stubborn belief. Till the age of 40, my average monthly salary as a founder was ~30k. Barely any savings after 15 years of building. Out of the three startups I built, one paid back moderately. Two were write offs. Only in the last two years did I see a 6 figure salary for the first time in my career.\n\nBut I’ll be honest, if you stay long enough in the game, sometimes it pays back in ways you never planned for. What I get to do now wasn’t even on my bucket list. But entrepreneurship created that pathway.\n\nSo, not every founder will ring the IPO bell or build a unicorn and that’s okay. The win isn’t always the valuation. Don’t fool yourself and build something meaningful. It will take time and it will take more out of you than you planned. It’s the resilience you build while fighting to survive that creates your pathway. \n\nStay stubborn & keep building.\nThe world may not notice you yet.But when it finally does, it’ll act like it believed in you from day one.",

  "text": "Hey Deepinder - love seeing this and your continued interest towards health. Having met a lot of healthy food founders over the past few years and investing in a few, one big learning is people don’t want “healthy”, they want familiar food made better. \n\nAnything that sounds like “we’ll make you healthy” alienates the mainstream user. Parathas and Biryanis are not bad. It can be prepared in a healthier way. \n\nSome thoughts from our experience of working with companies in this space. \n\n1. Most “healthy eating” products fail because they expect the user to change habits overnight. I think there is an opportunity for Zomato to perhaps subtly nudge users. Like someone ordering a pizza at 10pm. You could suggest healthier alternatives. Don’t take away dosa, just add an option to make it with less oil.  \n\n2. Most Indians don’t relate to quinoa and kale. They relate to better rotis, less sugar, and less fried snacks. The challenge is late dinners, long sitting hours, and irregular eating. There could be an opportunity to personalise timing and portion cues and that can do more good than macro labels.\n\n3. People have been misled by “low fat”, “organic”, “fit” claims for years. We’ve to take a stand to show ingredient level truth & not marketing adjectives. You can enable that through your platform. \n\n4. Healthy options often cost 1.5–2x more, which limits repeat usage. Consumers will pay once for novelty, but daily health behaviour needs affordable habit loops.\n\nIf Zomato pulls this off right, it won’t just be a product feature but could shift public eating behaviour at scale. The real opportunity is to make healthier eating accessible and culturally relevant. That’s the hardest and most meaningful problem to solve.",

That’s the paradox of Indian sports. We will worship global icons but won’t invest in local talent. This isn’t about football or Messi.

  "text": "Sports is for everybody and every body. Never tell yourself you can’t do it. You are never too late. That’s Shilpa, my friend and training partner. You can see the pain on her face. That’s because she’s racing the clock to get to the finish line of a marathon. She is not a professional athlete but a senior exec in her mid 40s working in a tech company. For the past 15 years of running, she had one goal. To qualify for the Boston Marathon. And in this race she had to run under 3hr 45mins to qualify for her age category.\n\nWhy am i sharing this? We’ve a narrative in our society that people working 9 to 6 are always busy. And they can’t pursue goals which are outside their life at work or home. I’ve seen Shilpa train through pain, bad weather, and fatigue with consistency and no drama. For 16 weeks of the training we did together, there were good and bad days and days of self doubt & confidence.\n\nWhat’s invisible in this frame is also the tough times she had to endure mentally. Loss in family, work stress and injuries. Shilpa always had a purpose towards running. And we’d made a promise to each other- both will try to qualify for Boston. I made another promise to come back after finishing my race to cheer & run with her for the last few miles. That’s me in the picture behind her.\n\nWe all have a hidden identity in our life. Sometimes it’s an aspiration to be something we always wanted to be or the pursuit of discovering the unknown. Playing sports is life’s way of asking, how bad do you want it? And why? You can see it in her face. That’s what giving everything looks like to find the “why”.\n\nPlay sports to find your why. You’re never too late.",

  "text": "This is a news i read a few months back. Most schools in India don’t have a playground. In our cities, there are barely any open spaces left to go out and play. Yet we all have an opinion about India’s next gold medal or the future of sports.\n\nMost of our medal winners come from Tier 2 & 3 towns, and even they lack access to basic facilities.\n\nBefore we debate how to create champions, we need to build playgrounds and access. Whether it’s running, football, or playing any sport. India needs more places where people can simply show up and move.\n\nThat’s why Rainmatter has supported Michezo Sports , a company building sports infrastructure across India, giving everyday athletes, schools & communities a place to move, train, and play.\n\nWhen more people play, we seed the next generation of athletes and medal winners.",

Met two founders with completely different backgrounds but one common problem they both lived-the lack of healthy food.\n\nOne is a computer science engineer who was preparing for the IAS and kept falling sick because of long study hours and poor food options. The other left a well paying IT job to pursue a life around sports.\n\nToday, both are building a company that delivers healthy, freshly made meals to people’s homes every day. Started with a small kitchen and today delivering 700 meals per day.\n\nIndia needs more such founders solving for everyday health in simple, scalable ways. Founders who live the problem always build differently. Especially when the problem is health. These are the entrepreneurship stories we should cheer for.",

  "text": "There’s a new breed of social media influencers who love comparing what they escaped and finding pleasure in dunking on those who stayed back in India. It’s a stupid and lazy way to farm engagement. Most of these posts come from Indians settled abroad, carrying a  sense of superiority as if leaving India somehow made them wiser. \n\nThey talk about what “might have happened” had they stayed, framing India as a land of wasted potential. This commentary helps no one. It only tells young founders, engineers, and scientists buulding every day in India that their work isn’t worth it.\n\nTry building Aadhaar, UPI, or Zerodha from wherever you are. Before glorifying how you “escaped,” remember some people stayed back and built the very systems the world now studies.\n\nAnd if anything, feel proud that Indians today are among the most talented builders and leaders running global companies.",

  "text": "If there’s one thing America has mastered and India hasn't, is the the art of selling a story. The American Dream was the best marketing campaign of the 20th century. They sold the American Dream so hard that the brightest talent across the world left their homes to chase it. They postured about American Dynamism until every investor believed that innovation could only happen in Silicon Valley. \n\nThese stories gave them soft power, talent, and capital. I think India today is at a similar moment. Yes, we still wrestle with corruption, bureaucracy, and gaps in infrastructure. But so did the US in its rise. That didn’t stop them from relentlessly selling their own narrative.\n\nWhat India needs now is conviction to sell the Indian Dream. To build for 1.4B people and to create confidence among our entrepreneurs and consumers that Indian products and companies  and brands are worth backing and using. There are a ton of challenges we've in health, climate, education & energy. But these are the very challenges that can create opportunities.\n\nWe should call our problems what they are -trillion dollar opportunities.\n\nAmerica didn’t just build companies but built stories the world wanted to believe in. If America won on story and China on scale, India must win by solving the hardest problems for the most people living in India. The media, government & investors should constantly be talking about entrepreneurs here and the Indian Dream.",

  "text": "America just put a $100,000 price tag on the Indian dream. Never been a better time than now for Indian engineers to build at home. The US was the promised land for Indian engineers but not anymore. And India isn’t the India of the 90s when engineers moved out for better pay and exposure. \n\nEarlier generations left India because they didn’t have a choice. Today, staying back is the smarter choice. The US is telling the world that they want fewer immigrants, at higher prices & under tighter conditions. \n\nIn the 1960s & 70s, US actively recruited Indian doctors and engineers to fill shortages. In the 90s & 2000s, IT/software outsourcing made H-1B the obvious path for thousands of engineers. In reality, the India of today is not the India many left behind. \n\nThis is not to say India is without its own constraints. We still have infrastructure gaps and bureaucracy is still frustrating.\nBut if you look back at history, Indian engineers have always thrived precisely in moments of constraint. \n\nThe outsourcing opportunity of the 90s was born from wage arbitrage. The SaaS opportunity of the 2010s came from building global software with frugal & distributed teams. Each cycle has taken adversity and Indian entrepreneurs turned it into advantage.\n\nThe next cycle will be no different. The very inefficiencies of India around fragmented supply chains, healthcare gaps, broken education models will be the anchor to build world class companies. To solve for India is to solve for the future of other emerging markets.\n\nThis is the great inversion of our time and for the first time in history, the opportunity cost of leaving India may be greater than the opportunity cost of staying.\n\nThe last generation of Indian engineers built America’s tech backbone. The next generation has the chance to build India’s. Come back home. Time to build for India and from India.",

Your title or professional background doesn’t matter. What matters is walking the talk so your kids grow up seeing health & fitness as normal.\n\nYour kid’s health is a function of their habits and not their genes. Fix the inputs and the outputs take care of themselves.\n\nRainmatter- Zerodha will take care of everything. All you have to do is show up with your kid. Just once a month. We’ll play a sport, run, or do a workout together and cheer for each other. No one will sell you anything. Just play, sweat, and joy.\n\nWould you be interested?",

  "text": "This was a news headline for the last few days. Here's what happened. An American on Twitter/X asked if any Indian had done anything truly major in the modern era. It went viral and soon turned into the usual routine of mocking India’s achievements. I'd to remind him about ISRO's Chandrayaan 3 which India did it at 1/20th the budget to a part of the moon NASA still hasn’t reached, and about UPI in India while US struggles with real time payments. He conveniently ignored the four Indians winning Nobel Prizes in the modern period.\n\nI'm sharing this here as a reminder that this isn’t the first time and it won’t be the last, that India’s achievements are mocked. But while others troll, we've to build in India, build for India and build for the world.\n\nWe just need to stay focused and keep building and sometimes when the trolling gets too loud, a little schooling is necessary.",

  "text": "I’ve never shared this before. We keep glamorizing entrepreneurship with stories of valuations, big exits & high salaries. But i hate to say this, for most founders the journey will look nothing like that. And you’ve to internalise this for your own mental health. \n\nMedia will write about high salaries of unicorn founders and the 50cr apartment they bought. Many folks read this and see entrepreneurship as a gateway to quick wealth. Nothing wrong with that aspiration though. \n\nTill the age of 40 (in 2023), my average salary as an entrepreneur was ~30k/month. Barely had any savings across 15 years of entrepreneurship.\n\nDid that really work out? Out of three startups, one barely paid for the five years I gave it. The other two shut down.\n\nOnly in the last 2 years did I start seeing a six figure salary for the first time in my career.\n\nOh, and in 2018, every bank rejected my home loan because a founder was considered a “risk profile.” I had to borrow from an NBFC at 12%.\n\nI’m not sharing this to scare people. Just don’t let that what you read online get to your head.\n\nEntrepreneurship looks glamorous in hindsight. In reality, it’s years of uncertainty, low pay, and stubborn belief. But if you stay long enough in the game, sometimes it pays back in ways you never imagined.\n\nFor me, what I get to do now was never part of the bucket list. But entrepreneurship created a pathway.\n\nI read this somewhere- we need innovators, but we also need martyrs. And that’s a painful badge.",

  "text": "Most AI health apps in India die because they’re over engineered & lack context . I’ve seen 100s of pitch decks and 90% won’t survive past downloads. Not because AI isn’t powerful, but founders chase the wrong use case. Sharing notes so we can build better.\n\n1) Most copy US models built for digitized EMRs and dump it into India, where 90% of records are on paper. AI outside the doctor patient flow is useless. Clinicians are burnt out and AI must make them faster, not force them to learn another software.\n\n2) It’s a foolish assumption to think patients will log in daily. In India, 80% patients are episodic & they show up sick & vanish when better. Retention needs habit + urgency, and you can’t build habit if your app doesn’t solve a daily pain point.\n\n3) Everyone boasts “Our AI predicts disease before symptoms.” That’s not a feature, it’s a liability. In healthcare, trust is the product and one wrong prediction and you’ve lost it for good. Especially in a low trust market, this backfires. \n\n4) AI isn’t free. Most app position it like that. In a price sensitive market like India, no one will pay 500 bucks/month for “insights” when a real GP costs 500/ visit.  AI can augment, but it can’t replace human trust and follow up.\n\nIf you really want to solve for Healthcare using AI then integrate into existing healthcare touchpoints.\nMake AI invisible and just make the care feel faster, cheaper, more accurate. Build trust as your moat.",

  "text": "Someone I know recently lost a family member. The medical bills crossed 20 lakh in just four weeks and only half was covered by insurance and now the family is in debt. This is the sad part of our healthcare system. If we truly want to improve quality of life in India, we must start by making healthcare accessible and affordable.\n\nI’m not an economist, but after working with many healthcare founders, one thing is obvious that our low public health spending means poor access and families paying from their own pockets often go into debt.\n\nLook at the numbers-India spends just 3.3% of its GDP on healthcare. In comparison: the US spends 17–20%, the UK 11%, China 7.7%, and Japan 8%. Even smaller economies like Thailand 4.3%, Vietnam 5.9% and Brazil 9.5% are ahead of us.\n\nWe lag far behind both in terms of GDP share and per capita health spending. What’s worse is, most healthcare costs in India are paid directly by households. The only way to bring balance is by significantly increasing public health spending by the government. \n\nWe need to make primary healthcare truly universal across every city and village. Expand public health programs so no one lives in fear of hospital bills. And most importantly, regulate private healthcare to ensure price transparency, medical accountability, and protection of the poorest from predatory billing.\n\nAffordable, accessible healthcare doesn’t just save lives. It protects families from poverty.",

  "text": "We meet dozens of startups every week that are launching AI based health apps. The pitch is always the same- “solving healthcare for a billion people.” But when you download the app, it’s mostly ChatGPT wrapped in a cute chatbot that gives generic advice. And most apps are a glorified symptom checker and an e-commerce app selling medicines , lab tests, or 10-minute doctor consults. \n\nI don’t understand why founders are talking  DAU, MAU or GMV. This is not really a solution to Digital Health and won’t fix anything for Indian Healthcare. \n\nHealthcare isn’t a SKU business. It’s not a game of faster logistics or viral acquisition. It’s about trust, clinical accuracy, and longitudinal care. None of which can be solved by just throwing venture money at marketing or pushing discount coupons on diabetes tests.\n\nIf your product doesn’t help people stay healthy, if it doesn’t build continuity of care, you’re not solving healthcare. It’s just another transactional platform. \n\nIf you genuinely want to solve for healthcare, you’ve to understand that India’s real healthcare problems is non-communicable diseases, low doctor-to-patient ratios, Inconsistent follow-ups and zero care continuity, lack of integration between diagnostics, doctors, and data, No longitudinal health record for most citizens and poor patient literacy and trust in digital advice.\n\n90% of Indians don’t have access to longitudinal health records, which makes continuity of care impossible.\n\nMost Indian health apps are still consumer tech products, not health tools.\n\nIndia’s healthcare crisis isn’t a UX problem. It’s a delivery and outcomes problem.",

  "text": "Rainmatter by Zerodha is investing in Lo Foods.\nHere's the backstory on how this happened. \n\nTwo years ago, I cold messaged Sudarshan. Told him I liked what he was building and asked if he was raising a round. He didn’t reply.\n\nA few months later, I get a message from him saying they are raising now and we should catch up. I got a bit delayed to respond and next thing I know, Sudarshan was activating every human connection possible to get me to respond :) \n\nWhen we finally met, what stood out was his deep passion to solve for nutrition. Not just from a founder POV, but from someone who’s coached people one-on-one, using science backed programs. That lived experience matters and most founders miss out on this. \n\nLo Foods feels like a brand that isn’t demonising carbs, fats, or sugar. It’s creating functional foods that fit real Indian plates and regional palates. I’ve written before about why nutrition products in India need to be local-first. \n\nWe’re thrilled to partner with Sudarshan Gangrade and the team at Lo Foods to build India’s next wave of functional foods.\n\nPS: He also asked me to write more nice things about him, but you know me :) Try their products, send us feedback. We’ll need it for our next review meeting anyway 😄",

  "text": "Every week, I get a 10 new startup pitches that says “We’ll deliver healthcare in 10 minutes.” Quick commerce is now rushing into healthcare. So I thought to do a breakdown on what’s hype and what might actually work in India. \n\nWhat could work?\n1)30–60 min medicine delivery can work for chronic refills or acute needs. In metros with dense demand, it's useful. But 10-min isn’t necessary. Even same-day is fine for 90% of use cases. And honestly, your local chemist is already doing that.\n\n2) Rapid diagnostics for home blood collection isn’t about speed but it’s about hygiene and reliability. A 2-hour sample pickup and next-morning results is a solid win. What we need is better logistics and trained phlebotomists, not faster scooters.\n\n3)On-demand nursing or paramedic visits but for use cases like wound care, IV, injections. Could work with proper scheduling. Think “Ola for nurses,” not “Blinkit for bandages.” Needs backend infra for verification, training, EMR integration.\n\nWhat won’t work (At least not now)\n1) Ambulance in 10 mins sounds great until you hit Delhi or Bangalore traffic. Speed is useless without triage and location accuracy. What we really need is better coordination between hospitals and ambulance providers, not just faster wheels.\n\n2) On-demand doctors in 10 mins is a bad idea. You don’t need any doctor fast but you need the right one. Discovery & matching are bigger problems than speed. Most video consults struggle with quality, not timing. Clinical care isn’t fast food. Trust takes time.\n\n3) The 10-min everything app for healthcare is lazy ambition dressed up with VC money. Healthcare isn’t a SKU game but it’s complex, regulated, and hard to standardize like groceries. Great for funding buzz, terrible for trust and real outcomes.\n\nFew thoughts if you really are passionate to build in healthcare. \nTrust > velocity.\nSpeed isn’t everything.\nInfra & people ops > APIs.\nReliability > 10-min hacks.\nHealth is longitudinal & not transactional.\n\nGood luck if you're building something in Healthcare in India.",

  "text": "These days, I see more and more founders sharing posts that begin with “We’ve decided to shut down our startup”. I have immense respect for every founder who says it out loud and admits something they believed in deeply didn’t work out and owns it. It takes courage.\n\nIn all these posts the most common comment is “Good luck for the next innings,” “You will bounce back,” “waiting for your comeback .” But no one is asking the founder- “How are you holding up?”\n\nMaybe people don’t know how to ask and maybe we don’t know how to answer. Because it’s much easier to celebrate beginnings, fund raise and acquisitions. \n\nI didn’t realize how much of my identity was tied to the company when we shut down and i stopped getting new emails and our Discord channel was dissolved. Suddenly i no longer had a “thing” that i can say i was building. \n\nIt took me a long time to feel new again and longer than I admitted to anyone. I felt sad, not because we failed but because I thought I was supposed to “bounce back” faster. We rarely talk about the emotional wreckage that a shutdown leaves behind. Nobody prepares you for this part. \n\nMaybe as an ecosystem, the next time someone says they’re shutting down, don’t rush to ask “what’s next.” Perhaps send them a direct message asking- How are they holding up and ask them if they need any help.\n\nSometimes, that question is the difference between someone feeling invisible and someone feeling seen. Even in the startup world, endings deserve dignity. \n\nAnd if you’ve been through it yourself, talk about it. You never know who might need to hear it.",

  "text": "Got a message yesterday from a friend that they lost their 7 day old baby last week. Got me thinking why this happens and turns out, it’s not uncommon.\n\nIndia’s infant mortality rate is about 25 per 1,000 births. That’s 2.5% of infants who don’t survive. The sad part is that nearly 60% of these deaths are preventable with better care. \n\nThis is where I believe AI in healthcare can truly make a difference. \nWe can develop predictive models for at-risk pregnancies using maternal health data. Build remote monitoring systems that flag early signs of preterm labor. Even use image based diagnostics to catch neonatal infections before they turn fatal.\n\nI hope more people building for healthcare in India focus on solutions that can detect risks early and save lives. No parent should lose a child to something we could’ve seen coming.",

I'll say it again- a founder’s health is the real moat of the business.\n\nThis isn’t just for our portfolio. It’s for every founder in India-whether you’re funded by us, by someone else, or by no one at all. No pitch decks. No filters. You just have to show up.\n\nWhy are we doing this? Because everyone talks about product market fit. But no one tells the founder: You are the most valuable IP in the company. Don’t burn out.\n\nWhich city should we do next?

  "text": "I never wanted to be a VC and I never thought becoming an investor after being a founder would be this hard. \n\nFor most of my founder journey, I got rejections. Now I sit on the other side, and I’m the one giving rejections to others. And it’s painful. Not because it’s part of the job but because I know what that rejection feels like.\n\nBecoming a VC was never a career goal. I loved building and scraping things together. There is always a weird pleasure in that messy, glorious founder's life.\n\nBut it was one of those catchups with Nithin, when he told me- “Let’s build something that is not like a typical VC fund.” And that was my source to regain my founder high and honestly I’m still figuring this out. \n\nSome days, I feel like a tourist in VC. Other days, I feel like I’m helping create something from scratch. That paradox somehow lives in me every day. I told Nithin the same- I’d rather be known for what I build than what I fund. That’s why my bio still says entrepreneur and not VC. Somehow I still can’t fully relate to that title. \n\nNithin’s trust to build something that doesn’t exist gave me permission to see Rainmatter by Zerodha differently. Not just a fund but a place we’re building with founders at the center. Even the ones we don’t invest in. This feels like being an investor with a founder’s soul. \n\nI’ve started to realize my role now is to be useful. To cheer for entrepreneurs and to show up sometimes with capital, but often just with time, empathy, and perspective. Sometimes it's reminding someone that their health matters more than their next funding round. And sometimes, it's okay with not having a perfect answer.\n\nAll I know is- I still want to build. Even if what I’m building now isn’t a product. It’s an ecosystem. And that’s enough for today. \n\nI'm writing all of this, first for my own mental clarity. And also to be honest with all the founders who reach out to me, and the other people who ask me for career advice.\n\nI don’t have a grand vision of what this role should be. It’s evolving. Slowly. And maybe that’s the point. Not every journey needs a playbook.\n\nYou may be a founder, someone working in a startup or building things at a large company. If you’re confused about your career, it's ok. \n\nI still don’t have all the answers yet. I’m still becoming.",

  "text": "If you’re a founder, Rainmatter by Zerodha wants to cheer for your health.\n\nMost founders get advice on how to acquire customers, sell products, and raise capital. I think what is not been said enough is- \n\nFounder’s overall health is the moat of the business. Your mental health is the real runway. Your fitness defines the sustainability. And your anxiety levels determines the stability. \n\nWe can’t invest in every startup or founder. But I believe every founder deserves someone in their corner, especially when it comes to their health. I wish something like this existed when I was a founder. Maybe I would’ve felt a little less broken- physically and mentally.\n\nWhether you’re funded by us, someone else, or no one at all. It doesn’t matter. No eligibility here. Just need to be a founder who wants to start prioritising their health. \n\nWe want to hangout with you where we workout together with other founders. No pitch decks and no small talk. We will- run, lift, cycle, jog. Do something to grind together with other founders. You just need to show up. \n\nIf you’re in, drop your name here. I’ll send you an invite with details.

We've to bring a change in the culture else this armchair commentary won’t help anyone. \n\nWe've decided to make some efforts at Rainmatter by Zerodha. Alongside our usual focus on fitness and preventive health, we've invested 60cr+ to support companies making sports education and participation easier, more affordable, and culturally relevant.

  "text": "Doctors in India die earlier than their patients. I know it sounds crude but what it means is Indian doctors have a life expectancy that’s nearly 10 years shorter than the average Indian. And this is reported by Indian Medical Association. \n\nThe primary causes are Cardiovascular disease and infections. Ironically, the very things they work tirelessly to prevent.\n\nEndure 10-12 years of medical education with the only aspiration to save lives but be at the receiving end of stress, anxiety, and long working hours. And be a part of a system that doesn’t give them time to care for their own health. The average Indian doctor clocks 60–80 hours a week and approx 300-400 doctors die by suicide every year. Mostly because of the impossible expectations they carry. It takes 10+ years of study before a doctor sees their first salary.\n\nThey’re taught that saving lives is everything. After 10hrs+ of work, you can then go and figure your own personal health & family life. And after all this, they’re now told that AI will make them obsolete. That their jobs will be replaced by software tools because the system is inefficient.\n\nI meet atleast 50 companies a month that pitch AI solutions for healthcare. These tools matter and they can make processes faster and improve accessibility. No doubt Indian healthcare needs better processes and better tech. But what it needs more than anything is empathy.\n\nIndia’s hospitals are crowded and the health crisis is real. But what’s also been ignored is the mental and physical health of our doctors & medical staff. \n\nThis isn’t a rant against technology, AI or healthcare system. But a reminder to self and maybe a few who are reading this that without empathy and without recognizing the human cost, there will be no healthcare system left.",

  "text": "An advice from one entrepreneur to another thinking to become a founder today. Manifest this reality-it’s going to be hard. Harder than you imagine. Blogs and YouTube videos are designed to make you feel good. They’re useful, but they’re mostly made by people who seen some form of success. Don’t start thinking there’s a single linear path. The journey will be be scary and lonely.\n\nTake care of your health, both physical and mental. Walk, run, meditate, lift, cycle, swim. Just do anything. Don’t wait for a crisis. There’s no pivot for your body.\n\nDon’t take your relationships for granted. You think they’ll wait, but they won’t. And they shouldn't.  Everyone has finite time to build a life. You’re not wealthy if you have no one to share it with.\n\nLastly, don’t chase status. It’s the surest way to damage your joy and clarity. Every mistake is an opportunity to improvise. Get good at being corrected without being offended. The rest will follow if you build from a place of authenticity and love for the craft.",

Why else will lakhs of young folks take to the street in the middle of a working day. \n\nThese aren’t daily wage workers but young & educated with smartphones, fandom merch, and the physical energy to stand for hours on road and make video reels. Btw, 14% of our youth are unemployed today. \n\nSame happens when a new Apple store opens. Thousands gather, not to buy, but to show their desires a belonging.\n\nSometimes I think the food and 10min delivery companies have done more to keep the social order than any policy.\nDelivery boys & riders have found work. They’ve a reason to show up, even if it’s not perfect. Imagine if they didn’t have that work.\n\n30% of India is under the age of 29 today: When the youth can’t find meaning in work, they’ll seek it in crowds, in fandoms and in shallow status games.",

  "text": "There is enough evidence of reckless school bus driving in India. It’s 2025 and we are still looking away. Every morning, I see a few school bus going the wrong way against traffic just to save a few 100 meters. The buses are packed with children and parents are standing by, smiling and waving goodbye as if nothing’s wrong.\n\nI’m sure this is common across cities and schools including the so-called elite ones.\n\nWe want our kids to learn coding at 5, speak three languages, and use the latest gadgets. But we are comfortably ignoring road safety and not questioning the system that lets an unsupervised driver gamble with kids lives every day. \n\nIf you’re a parent, your biggest responsibility is to ask your school to install a dash cam on every school bus and share a feed to you everyday. There is tech to detect rash driving. You’ve to ask the schools to use systems that track, record, and report unsafe behaviour.  \n\nIf you witness a reckless school bus driver, take a photo or video of the incident, capture the bus number and report the incident to the school immediately. Educate your kids on what’s unsafe and how to report it to teachers & parents without fear.\n\nIf an action is not taken by the school, gather support from other parents and file a complaint with the local police and RTO. Reckless school drivers should be jailed. \n\nJust don’t stay silent. One firm parent can set off a chain of accountability. When tragedy happens, we blame everyone. There is no point doing that when we can avoid it. Don’t let ignorance be the reason your child gets hurt.",

  "text": "There are a few investors who have turned startups into status games. I’ve held back on saying this for a while but it needs to be called out. They will host events only for IIT/IIM founders. Some call it a mixer, but invite only unicorn founders and flaunt selfie pics with them. \n\nI’ve nothing against IIT/IIM or unicorn founders. Most are smart entrepreneurs. But the job of VCs is to help create an ecosystem regardless of the pedigree. Creating exclusive clubs and playing these popularity games is the worst status games to play in entrepreneurship. \n\nI was a founder with no pedigree. So when I see startup events filtered by tags, I know exactly who gets left out. It’s the same kind of founders who are already battling self doubt, limited visibility and zero access.\n\nThis is exactly what happened in the job market 10 years back. Most job descriptions asked for IIT & IIM degree- even if the role had nothing to do with it.\nAnd we lost a whole generation of talent to that lazy filter.\n\nAs a society we’ve mistaken proximity for potential. And that’s a dangerous filter for India that is trying to build its identity to value innovation.\n\nIf you are a founder- don’t waste time trying to get into rooms built on pedigree.\nBuild something so real, they have no choice but to knock on your door. Your worth isn’t defined by where you come from, but by what you create.",

What edge do you bring that a thousand others don’t?\n\nPeople often ask why we cheer and share about startups we haven’t invested in. It’s because we are not just investors, we’re here to build ecosystems. And India needs that now. \n\nMost VCs love to talk about their portfolio. But the reality is, market doesn’t reward portfolios. It rewards categories. And in India, we need large movements along with unicorn outcomes. \n\nAt Rainmatter, I’ve seen hot deals been let got :). We’ve never played the status game. We support founders and even their competitors, if it helps grow the category and the narrative. When more people understand health, money, and climate and more builders create solutions-everyone wins\n\nBtw, we do podcast with founders we didn’t fund :). I share our observations and learnings openly from our portfolio companies. \n\nThere are 2000 VC funds in India. I'm hoping some of them starts thinking beyond the old Silicon Valley VC model.",

But no clue how to build a decent drainage system in the tech capital of the country. \n\nWho’s to blame and who’s  accountable- I honestly don’t know. Maybe it’s the system or it’s us. Maybe we were too busy building unicorns to notice the roads turning into rivers. One thing is for sure that the ESOPs, villas, and startup exits won’t buy us a shortcut through this mess.\n\nEveryone wants to “change India”.

  "text": "I know someone who worked for one of the world’s biggest tech companies. Almost 20 years of loyalty and last week was laid off. He is a brilliant engineer who showed up every day and solved some of the hardest engineering problems. Mentored tons of juniors and fixed bugs that saved millions. \n\nLast week, an email decided his time was up. Because a new AI tool is now optimising for internal cost.\n\nI’ve been saying this to everyone around me, the world doesn’t reward loyalty. It rewards leverage. If you’re quietly building, chances are you’re quietly disposable too. Wether you are a founder, employee or just anyone. \n\nI don’t say this to be cynical. I say this so we stop waiting for the system to be fair. It won’t be. Work is no longer a family, it’s a market. You are not being exploited but being priced. The system isn’t cruel, it’s just indifferent. This might sound cold but is the reality. Stop expecting fairness from systems and start designing freedom for yourself.\n\nSo build leverage, build relationships build your voice. Build equity in something that can’t be taken away in a reorg. And above all, build something that doesn’t require someone else’s permission to keep you going.",

  "text": "The top 5 sports brands in India generate 12,000+ crore in revenue and not one is homegrown. In a country with 700M under age of 30 & a growing fitness culture, no Indian brand has even a modest share. Some of our companies work with these global brands. Here’s what I’ve learnt.\n\n1)Nike, Adidas & Puma sell aspiration that makes you feel like an athlete before you become one. Decathlon cracked India with trust & access. No celebs, just quality at honest prices. It's where middle class families discover sport. That's how habits & loyalty are built.\n\n2) Most Indian brands sell athleisure, not performance. They look good but fail under stress, no real R&D, no athlete testing. They sell products, not belonging. No community building, no running clubs, no athlete support. That’s where global brands pull ahead.\n\n3) Indian brands chase influencers and Instagram aesthetics, but lack consistency, offline presence, distribution and category focus. Sports is tactile & people want to try products before buying. Global brands win with retail, experience, and trust. Indian brands stay stuck online.\n\nHow does Indian consumer think? \n1) Indian consumers are price-conscious, but not at the cost of aspiration. They’ll skip a local ₹2,000 shoe and instead save up for a Nike or Puma at ₹6000+ because global brands offer trust and status. Price alone doesn’t win, perceived value and brand story matter more.\n\n2) Most Indian brands still design with a male first lens but urban women shop more for running, yoga and fitness. If you ignore them you miss the fastest-growing segment. The average Indian buyer choose safe & established over new and edgy.\n\nIndian brands sell sportswear but global brands build sport culture. I think if you can make performance cool, communities visible, and quality obvious. There’s a real shot at the pie. But it won’t be quick. You’ll have to play the long game.",

  "text": "I’ve been a founder for ten years, and an investor for the last two. Having been on both sides of the table, I wish more people spoke openly about two truths that haven’t changed over the years. First-entrepreneurship is still scary. Second-raising money won’t save you from that fear.\n\nIn the beginning when you starting up, you will be scared of whether the idea will work. As you grow, you will be scared of losing what you've built. And at scale, you will be scared of irrelevance, competition, and the weight of expectations. \n\nIf someone tells you, “It’s only scary in the early days”, they’re either lying, lucky, or haven’t been through enough cycles. Fear is not a phase. It’s part of the job.\n\nThere’s no safety net. No sabbatical. No social security in entrepreneurship. So, step one is accepting the fear. Don’t wait for it to go away. It won’t. Learn to operate with it. \n\nAnd then if you think raising money will solve your fear. It will not. In fact, funding often will add more fear. Now you're accountable because you have burn. And your decisions are being watched, measured, and judged.  You’re not just building a company but managing other people’s money, expectations, and reputations. Money will buy you time, not peace. \n\nIf you're building something right now and you're scared, its good. It means you're alive to what matters. Just don’t let the fear fool you into thinking you’re not ready. The fear doesn’t go away. But with time, you get better at walking with it.\n\nThe world may not see you yet. But you’re already doing the hardest part of showing up despite the fear. And that’s what founders are made of.\nGood luck friends!",

  "text": "Most companies think building a health first culture means signing a cheque for an employee wellness program. I can tell you with confidence that that culture isn’t a perk you can outsource to a vendor and forget. \n\nAt Zerodha & Rainmatter, staying healthy isn’t a policy. It’s a shared language across the company. We show up as a team. We move. We push each other. We recover. We laugh. And then we get back to work with more clarity and less ego. Be it weekdays or weekends we're talking & doing fitness together all the time. \n\nCulture is what you do, not what you sponsor. And that's one of our moat.",

  "text": "Hospitals are the only profitable healthcare businesses in India. Top 5 hospitals made 47000 crore in revenue last year. Startup founders building in health can learn more from studying a hospital business than downloading health apps of their competitors. \n\nHospitals win because they control the full stack: diagnosis, treatment, follow-up. They have built-in distribution via doctors & insurance. And they’re anchored in trust. Preventive health in India still sells vitamins, not outcomes. There is high churn & zero trust.\n\nIf you’re building a preventive health startup, work on these first principles:\n\n1) Own outcomes not engagement. Show real wins like weight lost, BP controlled, diabetes reversed. Hospitals thrive because people must act. Nobody forgets a surgery. Everyone forgets a health checkup.\n\n2) Indians don’t trust digital care. They trust doctors, nurses, buildings they can walk into. Startups must build local trust, not just national scale. People follow health advice from someone they trust around them. Think clinics, coaches, phlebotomists not faceless dashboards.\n\n3) Anchor your business to real pain. Not aspirational health. Reframe prevention as pre-crisis management, not “wellness.” \n\n4) Make it hard to churn. Hospitals don’t need retention teams but patients come back because they must. Can you build the same emotional gravity?\n\n5) Bundle services like hospitals do. Diagnosis + protocol + human handholding = retention. Sell the whole experience, not one off lab tests or consults. Most apps offer “lifestyle programs” with no human involvement, and 80% drop-off in 90 days.\n\nWhat hospitals can’t do? They can’t be proactive, scalable, or delightful. They're stuck in reactive, bloated models. There is an opportunity for startup founders to build “digital hospitals for the 90%” that is preventive, distributed, affordable, and habit-forming.\n\nThe Indian preventive health market won’t be won by better UI. It’ll be won by startups that behave like digital hospitals: trusted, accountable, painful to leave. You’re not fighting apathy, you’re fighting the absence of urgency.",

  "text": "Big fan of what Y Combinator has done for founders. But I’ve never understood the obsession with building a YC equivalent in India by investors here. I’m convinced it will never happen. Not because we lack talent or ambition, but because YC wasn’t just a structure. It was the outcome of a rare mix of time, place, and cultural defaults.\n\nYC emerged in a place where risk was cheap, talent was abundant, trust was a default & failure was celebrated as a credential. India has almost none of those ingredients in the same proportion yet.\n\nIndian founders are world class at surviving, hacking & stretching resources. But YC worked because it taught founders to focus on scaling instead of surviving.\nIndian early stage capital still acts like it's lending money , not taking risk. Even seed rounds come with board seats and monthly reporting. \n\nThe genius of YC was its narrative monopoly. They created status & not just capital. India’s status economy works differently. You can’t manufacture prestige in India without a IIT, IIM next to your name.\n\nIndia won’t have its YC. But maybe that’s a good thing. \nWhat we need in India is founder first micro VCs with real skin in the game. A media and narrative engine that spotlights Indian builders solving Indian and world problems from India.",

  "text": "Because we invest in healthcare, I get this question all the time: Will AI replace doctors? As a technology optimist I don’t claim to have all the answers. But i feel this question usually reveals how little we understand both about AI & healthcare.\n\nWhen people say AI will replace doctors and teachers in the next decade. They  assume that intelligence is enough to make an impact and forgets that trust is the real currency in both healthcare and education.\n\nDoctors don’t just prescribe, they hold your hand during a cancer diagnosis. Teachers don’t just deliver content but they spot the kid falling behind, build confidence, and unlock potential. AI can assist, but it can’t replace human empathy and trust.\n\nSo is AI important? Absolutely.\nAI can read scans better than most radiologists. It can solve for homework & personalise lessons faster than a teacher. It can democratize access to world class knowledge, in any language, at near zero cost.\n\nBut can it replace the human relationship that sits at the core of these professions? AI doesn’t replace doctors. It replaces inefficiencies around them. Likewise AI won’t replace teachers. But it can free them from admin so they can actually teach\n\nTech is best when it’s invisible. When it supports human work & not erase it.\nYes, AI will change healthcare & education. The goal of AI shouldn't be to replace doctors & teachers. It’s to make a billion people feel like they finally have one. That’s the real opportunity & that’s where the best builders will focus i feel.",

  "text": "There’s a massive untapped opportunity to build a healthy quick service restaurant (QSR) business in India. But most have failed to scale. We’ve evaluated several for investment. Here’s a breakdown of why the model hasn’t worked yet & and what it’ll take to make it work. \n\nIndians are becoming more health conscious, cities are growing, incomes are rising. Yet every “healthy” QSR has failed to scale. Why? Because health is a feature, not a category. QSRs thrive on habit, indulgence & price. Three things health food companies struggles with.\n\n1) Healthy QSRs struggle in India because most consumers won’t pay a premium for “healthy.” Health is an aspiration, not a necessity. Why spend ₹300 on a salad when you can get a filling biryani or dosa for half the price? Value beats virtue every time.\n\n2) Healthy food ≠ crave worthy food. QSRs win by hitting the bliss point-fat, sugar, salt. Burgers & biryanis trigger dopamine, millet bowls don’t. A cheesy pizza will always beat a quinoa salad in a taste war. Cravings drive repeat orders. Not calories.\n\n3) Indian palates are habit-driven. Most eat the same 4–5 dishes weekly. Healthy QSRs fail when they push alien formats like quinoa bowls, lettuce wraps, hummus. They feel expensive, unfamiliar, and inconvenient. If it doesn’t fit the habit, it won’t scale\n\n4) Operational costs and unit economics don’t scale. Quality inputs cost more, wastage is higher & margins are thin. Without high margin add-ons like sodas and fries, balancing profit is tough\n\n5) In India, food is emotional comfort, not a guilt trip. Parathas, vada pav, jalebis bring joy. But most healthy QSRs feel like a scolding parent, not a treat. One sells discipline, the other sells happiness\n\nSubway has 900+ outlets in India with just one hero product- their sandwich. If that can scale, there’s room to build a better, healthier QSR. After speaking to founders who scaled or shut down, here are some thoughts on what it’ll take for a healthy QSR to work in India\n\n1) Sell delicious first, healthy second. QSRs thrive on cravings, not morality. No one buys “keto wraps”, they buy a butter chicken roll that tastes amazing (and happens to be healthy). Flavor wins. Health should be invisible, not the pitch\n\n2) Integrate into existing food habits. Forget quinoa bowls. Make millet biryanis. Forget lettuce wraps. Make chapati tacos. You must must disguise health inside familiar food formats\n\n3) Be affordable at scale. ₹400 won’t scale. ₹99–₹199 is the sweet spot.\n\n4) Solve for convenience, not just health. People will pay for speed & ease. If a healthy QSR takes longer than McDonald's or Zomato delivery, it won't work.\n\n5) Start with Gen Z & millennials. They don’t cook, care about fitness & crave social validation for eating well.\n\nA healthy QSR can work in India, if it stops preaching & starts entertaining. The winner won’t be the most nutritious, but the one that makes healthy food fun, tasty & affordable that people don’t even realize they’re eating right.",

  "text": "In the last five years, over ₹2 lakh crore has been lost to corporate frauds that includes high profile startups. Btw, financial fraud isn't a new phenomenon. It's as old as ambition itself. But when company leaders commit fraud, it's the employees who bear the brunt of losing jobs, financial security, and years of hard work.\n\nInvestors can write off their losses as part of risk capital but you as employees risk your most valuable asset- time and trust. Your company's culture code will scream about transparency but that doesn't mean anything if you don't get access to financial health of the company.\n\nThe only way to safeguard your professional career is to stay vigilant. The most basic you can do it to build your own financial literacy by understanding the company's profit & loss statement and balance sheet.  \n\nIn India, regardless of whether a company is public or private, organizations are mandated to file their financials with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA). Anyone can access these records through the MCA portal. You as an employee must cultivate the financial understanding of your company beyond vanity metrics and be prepared to act when red flags arise.\n\nIf you're not the owner, you're the product.",

  "text": "Met a founder last week, a computer science grad from Berkeley who chose to return to India and build an AI tool for children with speech disorders. He could’ve stayed back, joined Big Tech, and lived comfortably in the US. Instead, he came home to solve a deeply human problem from India, for the world.\n\nWhy? Because 3-5% of children globally are affected by stuttering and often face bullying and emotional isolation. It doesn’t just delay speech but impacts their confidence, identity, and the entire childhood. Speech is how we connect, express needs, and feel seen.\n\nThis is the kind of ambition and first-principles thinking often missing in the loud “Are Indian startups as good as US or China?” debate. These founders don’t chase headlines and mainstream media rarely writes about them. But they’re quietly shaping a new narrative for Indian startups.\n\nBecause building for real pain is harder than building for scale or valuation. And that’s exactly where India will win.",

  "text": "Today is World Health Day. Your HR will schedule team activities and your CEO will post about wellness being a core value. Brands will send you discount codes to remind you to eat clean and stay fit.\n\nEveryone will try to sell you an ideal world but no one really knows what you're going through. Being stuck in a 9 to 6 cycle, drowning in meetings, commuting for hours, and worrying about not being there for family. That’s the real health hazard. You already know health is important but it just doesn’t take priority in your chaotic daily life. I used to be that person. Always busy, always postponing and that ignorance cost me a lot. Both professionally & personally.\n\nYou just need to do something and do it consistently. Exercise, meditation, walk, sleep, eat clean, play & family. Go to therapy if you need to. Ignore what’s trending. All this longevity talk and health podcasts are of no good if you can't do simple basics.  \n\nRemember when you go back home tonight, your child or your parent won’t care how many meetings you had, how long you were stuck in traffic, or how crazy your inbox looked. All they want is your undivided attention.\n\nThe people who love you aren’t asking for a six-pack. They’re asking for your presence. Stay healthy not to impress the world, but to be there for the ones who matter.",

  "text": "India was once called a nation of call centers and it sounded like an insult. But quietly, it trained millions of young Indians to speak fluent English and dream beyond their hometowns. That was phase one.\n\nThen we became the IT back office of the world. And it created a generation of engineers who could write  code, manage complex systems, and deliver at global scale. That was phase two.\n\nToday, we’re in phase three. Indian startups are solving for India and it looks chaotic from the outside. These are signs of a country solving its own problems first, before solving the world’s.\n\nSure, we should go more deep tech and we will i think. But first we need more patient capital, more research led universities & more talent density. Deep tech ecosystem can't be built in a hackathon. It will be built by million engineers who get obsessed in solving billion daily problems.",

  "text": "When I was a founder, no one replied to my emails or returned calls. Now I'm an investor and everyone wants to meet me. This is a side of entrepreneurship no one talks about. I've been meaning to share these thoughts for a while now. \n\nAs a founder, I would reach out to investors, potential hires, partners and all kind of people. Mostly sending cold emails and begging for warm intros. Some days I’d open my inbox ten times an hour. Nothing. Not even a polite No. And every meeting I did get felt like charity. People would check their phones while I was passionately talking about what i'm building. It wasn’t just isolation, it felt being invisible & lonely. \n\nPeople say “build in public,” but the truth is, unless you’ve raised a lot of money or built a network around the big entrepreneur circle, you’re just noise in the feed. No one roots for you unless the world already has.\n\nNo one talks about this version of entrepreneurship where your startup is still ugly and half working. People don’t really meet founders. They meet press releases. Funding headlines. Vanity metrics. You don’t exist until TechCrunch or Yourstory says you do.\n\nI didn’t have time for personal branding. I was too busy building, selling and surviving. And most days i'll wake up wondering , am I building something real and useful? \n\nThen I became an investor. Suddenly, I was interesting.\nNow my inbox is overflowing. Everyone wants to meet me. Founders, operators, influencers, even the ones who never replied before. \n\nI get a lot of engagement on my posts & people tag me on social media. People ask for advice & feedback. They send decks, DMs & invite me as a guest to their events. Same events where i couldn't get entry earlier as a founder.  Irony is, I used to be ignored for building. Now I’m celebrated for betting. \n\nThis is the part that messes with your head. Not the rejection but how conditional the world’s attention really is. So now, I try to reply to every cold email. I take the calls that don’t scale. Because I know what it’s like to be building something real and feel completely invisible.\n\nIf you’re a founder in the trenches, just remember this. This world doesn’t reward quiet builders. It rewards loud signals. And when you're not seen, it eats away at your mental health. Not because you're weak. But because being human means wanting to be heard.  And if you’re on the other side, pause before you ignore the next unknown builder. Because today's nobody might be tomorrow's someone. And they’ll remember who replied.\n\nKeep going.\nThe world may not meet you yet.\nBut one day, it will pretend it always did.",

  "text": "India has 150 million+ people above the age 60 and there is a massive opportunity to keep them healthy & fit. But everyone’s focused on Gen Z and no one’s building for their parents. It’s a hard business but a big one. We’ve invested in two companies. Here’s why it’s tough and how one should crack it.\n\nUnderstand the reality first.\n1. Elders don’t think of “health” as proactive. They’re conditioned to wait until something breaks before acting. You’re selling a solution to a problem they don’t know they have yet.\n\n2. The 65-year-old needs it but their 35-year-old child pays for it.\nYou're not selling to the elder. You’re selling to their guilt-driven kids in Gurgaon or US. The buyer ≠ the user.\n\n3. Trust is everything and you don’t have it.\nIndian elders trust: Their doctor, astrologer & their neighbour\nNot apps. Not tech bros. Not AI. You can't growth hack trust. You earn it slowly, locally.\n\n4. They don’t want new habits. They’ve had the same breakfast for 40 years.\nYou’re not selling a product. You’re undoing decades of routine.\n\n5. Distribution is hyperlocal. Elders don’t click Insta ads. They talk to the uncle in their colony. You scale building by building not by user cohorts.\n\nYes, 150M+ elders. But it’s not one market. It’s a thousand tiny tribes.\nDifferent languages, cultures, food habits, family structures, and tech comfort levels. If it were easy, Tata or Reliance would’ve done it already. But it’s wide open now. The one who combines tech + trust + real care will win.\n\nSo how do you crack it?\n\n1. Think first principles & not trends\n Don’t build a “senior fitness app.”  Ask: Why did they stop moving? What gives them joy? You’re selling independence, not health.\n\n2. Design for peace, not features. One-click help, One daily routine, One trusted face. Great elder products feel like human care not software.\n\n3. Human-first, tech-enable.  Don’t replace the daughter. Support her. Train 100 amazing elder coaches. Build tools to help them scale.\n\n4. Don't focus on CAC. Here, it’s about trust per acquisition.  You’re not selling toothpaste. You’re asking to be let into their daily life. Start offline. Build trust then tech.\n\n5. You’re in the business of habit change & not selling an app or a pill.\nGet them to walk 15 minutes a day. Add protein to breakfast. Laugh more. Sleep better. Small wins compound. Don’t build for scale first. Build for consistency. \n Be in the business of habit change. \n\n6. This isn’t a hackable D2C play. It’s a decade-long trust business. Build for one community. Get to know 100 elders by name. Solve deep, boring problems with elegance. \n\nEveryone’s chasing the next billion youth users. But the hidden opportunity lies in serving the first 150 million elders.  The elder care market in India isn’t just underserved. It’s misunderstood and needs long-term play. Founders who crack this will build generational companies.",

It was always an overrated idea because it fundamentally misunderstood how healthcare actually works in India. Let me explain.\n\n#1 India’s healthcare is built on trust, not tech. The local doctor is a family confidant, not just a provider. People prefer seeing a doctor in person, even if it means waiting in long queues. They don’t trust prescriptions from an anonymous screen. In India, healthcare is about relationships, not transactions.\n\n#2 Telemedicine starts in the wrong place i.e talking to a doctor. But in India, healthcare begins with a test. Diagnosis comes first, then treatment. A video call can only advise a test, but the patient still needs a clinic visit. But why would the patient pay for an online consultation when they have to visit a physical clinic anyway? Healthcare is driven by diagnostics, not just consultations.\n\n#3 Healthcare in India is a family decision, not an individual one. A 60-year-old man with a fever isn’t booking a telemedicine consult but his family takes him to a doctor. People want reassurance, not a chatbot or a pixelated video call. Telemedicine assumed individuals would seek care alone, but that’s not how India works.\n\n#4 Telemedicine aimed to solve \"access to healthcare,\" but India’s real issue is access to quality care. Government hospitals lack trust, private clinics are costly, and random doctors on an app don’t inspire trust. In rural areas, people prefer the village doctor or pharmacist hey feel accountable in a way apps never could.\n\n#5 Telemedicine focused on one-time issues like fever or cough, but India’s real problem is chronic diseases like diabetes, hypertension, heart disease. These need ongoing care, not quick doctor chats. No diabetic wants to \"chat with a bot\" about sugar levels, they need a plan, a trusted doctor, and in-person care. Prescription is the real currency.\n\n#6 Most doctors in India were skeptical of telemedicine from the start. Not because they are anti tech, but because they don’t want legal liability for a patient they have never physically examined. If a misdiagnosis happens over video call, who is responsible? The doctor, the platform or the hospital? There were no clear answers and most experienced doctors don't want to risk their reputation.\n\nIf you're an entrepreneur building in healthcare, don’t chase convenience or optimize for speed. Build trust & optimize for quality care. I've written more elaborate notes on each of these points. Check the comments section.",

  "text": "Last week, I overheard a man casually tell his wife, “Tum gym jaa kar kya karogi”. This is a person who is well educated and seemingly progressive. \n\nJust celebrating one women’s day in a year doesn’t do any good. We’ve to change this assumption in our society that physical exercise and sports aren’t really meant for women. And lifting weights will make them look weird and fitness for women is about looking lean, not stronger.\n\nIf you walk into most gyms, you’ll find the space is still dominated by men. An outdoor run is still a luxury for most women in India even today since safety is a concern every time someone steps out. \n\nWe need to educate women and men that strength training is not just safe for women but it’s essential.\n\nA recent study reports that women get 20% less physical activity per week than men and they face the highest inactivity levels, with 33% failing to meet WHO guidelines. \n\nOne of the topics we’ve been thinking at Rainmatter is how we can create more safe spaces for women to get physical movement without the fear of being judged. \n\nWe need to build safe spaces and an ecosystem where women train & move without fear, without judgment and without needing permission.\n\nThis is why we partnered with Swetha Subbiah & Tanvie Hans and backed Sisters in Sweat, a fitness and sports community designed for women, by women.\n\nSupporting initiatives like Sisters in Sweat is just the start. The real change happens when we shift mindsets where every woman feels empowered to move. Every woman deserves the right to play a sport, run and feel strong without judgment and without asking for permission.",

  "text": "Everyone today loves this grand narrative that \"Tech will fix everything\". Every week a news article or investor confidently declares that tech will fix healthcare & most entrepreneurs fall for this illusion of disruption. This narrative is doing more harm than good.\n\nMost entrepreneurs today think, if we can build a beautifully designed app, use AI to chat, automate doctor-patient interactions, and scale it to millions of users, we can \"solve\" healthcare. \n\nIt sounds great in a pitch deck. It almost never works in reality.\n\nWhy? Because healthcare isn't e-commerce. You can’t scale a hospital bed like a food delivery fleet. You can’t disrupt chronic disease with a better UI. You can’t solve trust with a chatbot. Healthcare isn’t a transaction, it’s a relationship.\n\nIf you're serious about fixing healthcare, start thinking from first principles.\n\nEveryone wants to build the “Uber of Healthcare.” But Uber works because a ride from point A to B is a simple transaction. Healthcare isn’t. You can’t just match a patient with a doctor and assume the job is done. Don't build a generic doctor consultation app with a new UI or a marketplace that lists thousand doctor names. Focus on depth of care, outcomes, and follow-up treatments before chasing millions of users. Build a connected system that only focuses on driving outcomes.\n\nDon't over focus on AI without fixing the basics. AI can help a doctor diagnose faster. But it can’t replace the doctor. Yet, doctors alone won’t solve India’s healthcare crisis. They also need trained frontline workers assisted by smart tech. Build AI tools to assist doctors enable faster diagnoses. Don't oversell your AI engine or LLM models to a patient. \n\nIt doesn’t matter if we have the best doctor or AI engine if the right medicine isn’t available. Up to 20% of medicines sold in India are fake or substandard. Counterfeit drugs are a massive problem & the Pharma companies are growing this $58 billion market. Perhaps a great usecase to use AI and tech to streamline the supply chain. \n\nSo, can tech fix healthcare? Yes. \nBut not by replacing doctors, hospitals, or traditional care systems. The biggest healthcare opportunities in India are not about disruption but augmentation.\n\nTech alone won’t fix Indian healthcare. But finding the right places to apply can make a 10x difference. Healthcare isn’t an industry that gets \"disrupted\" overnight. But it can be upgraded piece by piece, solving for what really matters. And if you understand that, you’ll build something that actually works.",

  "text": "India’s protein market is booming but not in the way brands expect. As investors who’ve backed 10 different protein companies across various form factors, we’ve had front-row seats to what’s scaling well and setting cash on fire. Sharing some observations here.\n\n#1 There is some adoption to protein chocolates, wafers, and ready-to-drink beverages because they align with Indian eating habits. Indians snack, they don’t ‘supplement.’ You’ve to continuously prioritise taste over macros. Companies that market protein as an everyday indulgence rather than a rigid health choice gets customer attention. \n\n#2 Whey Protein is still the king due to consumer trust, but the buyer has evolved. The ‘gym bro’ audience is now joined by professionals, homemakers, and teenagers who want overall health. Companies are now positioning whey as a ‘daily wellness’ product rather than a muscle-building tool. Whey still has the highest consumer trust and branding built over a decade.\n\n#3 Plant or alternative protein needs more time for mass adoption. Unlike the West, India’s plant-based movement is not driven by ethics but by affordability and digestion concerns. Soy protein struggles with misinformation and pea protein is expensive. If you are a company in this space, maybe sell vegan protein as a ‘premium’ alternative to whey, rather than a ‘digestive-friendly’ option.\n\n#4 Indians think in meals, not macros. Global protein brands emphasize grams per serving. But Indians look for complete meals. You will therefore see entry of high-protein paneer, rotis & dosa mix formats.\n\n#5 Indians want taste first, nutrition second. In the West, function comes first. In India, taste dictates repeat purchases. Lower protein content per serving, but higher frequency of purchase. Brands that localize flavors (kesar badam, mango lassi, Thandai) get more customer attention. \n\n#6 Western brands lean on clinical studies. Indians trust Ayurveda and generational wisdom. The smart brands use both. \n\nIndia’s protein market isn’t a western import—it’s a local adaptation challenge. The companies that figure this out will dominate. The rest will keep burning capital trying to change consumer behavior that isn’t shifting anytime soon.",

  "text": "We've evaluated 50+ mental health apps for investments and I personally used 20+ products. None of them delivered meaningful results. The problem isn’t technology but the assumption that therapy is just pattern recognition & that AI can replace human presence. Here's a breakdown. \n\n#1 There is lack of emotional intelligence in the current AI models that are only designed to simulate conversation. But therapy is more than words. It’s about trust, micro-expressions, and intuitive emotional calibration—things AI still struggles with. Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and others can generate empathetic responses, but they don’t “feel” anything. They simulate and patients know the difference. \n\n#2 There is a large cultural and linguistic barriers in Indian context. Most AI models are trained in western psychological frameworks. Mental health challenges in India are unlike other cultures -societal expectations, family structures, and stigma. An AI chatbot trained on CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) modules from Western research and university doesn't understand the pressure of an arranged marriage or parental expectations in an IIT-obsessed household.\n\n#3 Most mental health apps claim to be “personalized.” In reality, they offer generic suggestions based on symptom checklists. Real therapists go beyond checklists. They adapt in real time &  modify their approach dynamically. AI, despite all its advancements, still struggles with this level of nuanced adaptability.\n\nSome thoughts how AI in Mental Health could actually work. \n\n#1 A good starting point is when AI supports therapists, not replace them. Imagine a model that helps analyze past therapy sessions and provide therapists with structured insights on patient progress. Instead of AI replacing human interaction, it should act as a co-pilot that enhances therapy effectiveness.\n\n#2 AI is fantastic at pattern recognition. We could use it to identify early warning signs of mental health deterioration by analyzing speech patterns, writing styles, and biometric data. Maybe hand over the interpretation and intervention to a real human therapist who can act on this data.\n\n#3 Mental health AI models need training data that reflect the Indian psyche. Solutions should be developed with inputs from Indian psychologists, using regional languages and culturally relevant therapy approaches. An AI that understands the shame associated with divorce in India or the anxiety induced by societal expectations will be far more effective.\n\nThe future of AI in mental health isn’t about replacing therapists; it’s about amplifying human connection. \n\nFounders building in mental health should focus on integrating AI where it excels (data analytics, early diagnostics, and habit formation) while keeping humans where they matter most (trust, deep healing, and emotional intuition).\n\nAI in mental health isn’t about AI being human. It’s about AI making humans better. That’s where the real opportunity lies.",

  "text": "If you’ve spent enough time in the tech industry, you’ll notice a growing trend-people are more focused on building narratives than companies. And the favourite one is declaring their city as the tech capital of India.\nBangalore is the “Tech Capital.” , Delhi is the “IPO Capital.”, Mumbai is the “Fintech Capital.” , Chennai is “SaaS Capital.”\n\nBut has anyone ever fought over being the sports capital of India? No- because talent emerges from everywhere. There’s no single agriculture or manufacturing capital either.\n\nWe should collectively move past this obsession with crowning a single tech hub. Instead of fighting over titles, our focus should be to make it easier to build anywhere. Better internet, lower compliance, and decentralised access to capital. We should stop forcing startups to relocate for funding.\n\nIndia’s tech future isn’t in one city-it’s in all of them. Let’s stop playing real estate games and start building the future. India is the perfect storm of talent, cost, market size, and ambition. Build here, and you’re not just solving for India; you’re solving for humanity.",

  "text": "There are over 500+ brands competing in India's healthy food market across quick commerce, online marketplaces & offline. Having engaged with over 80+ brands and investing in 10, there are some patterns & hard truths about scaling in this crowded space. This is a breakdown on marketing and distribution in healthy foods for founders & marketers.\n\nFirst, here’s what you need to know about Indian consumers.\n\n- Indians buy food based on trust, not just marketing – If a celebrity promotes it but their neighbour or friend doesn’t recommend it, they won’t buy it. Word of mouth is king.\n\n- There is low willingness to pay premium, but high spend on indulgence. People will hesitate on a ₹200 protein bar but will happily buy a ₹500 artisanal mithai box. You need to frame health as indulgence, not sacrifice.\n\n-They snack, they don’t diet. Instead of selling \"healthy diets\", sell better snacking alternatives. That’s why makhanas, chikkis, and seed mixes work.\n\n- Unlike the west, 70% of discretionary food spend happens during festivals. Brands that nails Diwali, Rakhi, Ramzan and weddings will win.\n\n-Instead of mimicking the US health food market, make Indian-first products. Local trumps global. India is not one country, it’s 20 mini-countries. What works in North won’t work in South. Regional customization is key.\n\n- Indians love flavor and indulgence. If your product doesn’t taste good first, it won’t sell. Aim to be a weekly purchase, not a one-time trend.\n\nMarketing Don'ts \n\n- Don't sell fear, guilt or magic. Most health marketers are doing exactly this. Fear of missing out on fitness. Guilt of not eating right. Magic solutions promising six-pack abs in six weeks,  “clinically tested” shortcuts . Health marketing shouldn’t be a psychological warfare. \n\n-Don't hijack medical language. Just because you put \"backed by science\" or \"doctor-approved\" in your ad ,doesn’t make it true. Most people don’t know what a randomized controlled trial is, but that doesn’t mean you should exploit their ignorance. Don’t throw a lab coat on a model, add \"Doctor recommended,\" and hope no one asks which doctor.\n\n-Don't create fake urgency – \"Only 3 packs left of our exclusive superfood\". Healthy eating isn’t a flash sale; trust and quality build long-term customers, not gimmicks.\n\nMarketing Do’s\n\n- The best health brands don’t sell a product, they sell a perspective. Tell the truth, but make it interesting.\nIf your product actually works, people will come back. No need to bait them with fake promises. Play the long game.\n\n-The best marketing in health is knowledge. Teach people something useful, and they’ll trust you. Educate, don’t manipulate.\n\n- Be honest, be helpful, and respect your customer’s intelligence. Anything else is just snake oil in new packaging. If your health product needs tricks to sell, it’s probably not worth buying. \n\nMore notes on distribution and growth shared in the comments section. Hope this is useful to founders , marketers and their brands.",

  "text": "The biggest flaw in startups is making early employees wait for an IPO to get paid while the founders and VCs cash out in secondary rounds. The people who took the deepest risks- the early employees are left holding paper wealth. The system isn’t broken, but it is imbalanced.\n\nIf secondaries were normalized for employees, the best talent wouldn’t be forced into golden handcuffs. They’d be free to bet on new ideas, creating more startups and more wealth. It’s unfair that Investors and founders can de-risk along the way, while early employees are told to ‘think long-term’ without the same options. \n\nHey founders, listen- when your company starts to do well, look at the people who made that possible. Wealth isn’t created by trapping talent, it’s created by freeing it. \n\nThere are 1.5 million direct jobs generated by startups in India today.

  "text": "If you’re an entrepreneur building for healthcare in India, don’t replicate U.S. or China models. It won’t work. I don’t know why many folks continue chasing templates that don’t fit India’s healthcare landscape. This is a breakdown for you.\n\nTo set context, there are three forces that shape Indian Healthcare:\n#1 Out-of-pocket expenditure: 54% of healthcare spending comes directly from patients (vs. 10% in the U.S., 35% in China).\n#2 70% of outpatient care is in private hospitals, while 60% of hospital beds are in government facilities. 80% of care is delivered by single-doctor clinics. \n#3 Urban India has 3.9 doctors per 1,000 people, rural India just 0.7. That’s the doctor density disparity.\n\nLets understand the U.S. market\nThe U.S. healthcare system runs on high-margin insurance networks, specialist-driven monopolies, and tech-heavy solutions like AI diagnostics and boutique hospitals. Their system is expensive, fragmented, and complex. \n\nWhy this will not work in in India-\n#1 54% of Americans (180M people) get health coverage through their jobs. In India, only 6% do.\n#2 U.S. hospitals mark up services 10x because insurers pay. In India, patients haggle upfront—no room for inflated billing.\n#3 U.S. hospitals profit from complex billing ($500 MRI scans). India’s best healthcare models profit from volume—Aravind Eye Care performs cataract surgeries at 1/1000th the U.S. cost. Incentives misaligned for India.\n#4 70% of Indians distrust private insurers (NSSO 2021). Insurance covers just 30% of healthcare costs (vs. 91% in the U.S.). Premium models here exclude 800M+ Indians earning <$5/day.\n\nNow lets understand the China market\nChina runs a hybrid system with state control, digital super-apps, and vertically integrated hospitals. AI-powered diagnostics, government-backed telemedicine, and centralized data help scale. \n\nBut India’s reality differs: Why this will not work in India-\n#1 China has 3 national insurers; India has 50+ state schemes and 25+ private insurers. Interoperability is a pipe dream.\n#2 China’s 1.4B health records are centralized. India’s digital health ID (Ayushman Bharat) has 500M registrations, but less than 5% have usable data. \n#3 China mandates compliance overnight. India’s 28 states have 28 regulatory frameworks. Unlike China, Indians distrust centralized control.\n#4 China’s 1.4B people speak Mandarin. India’s 1.4B speak 22+ official languages. A Hindi-first telemedicine app fails in Tamil Nadu.\n\nIf you really want to build a large healthcare company in India build from first principles- solve affordability & distribution. What can you do? \nMore notes shared in the comments section",

  "text": "India just beat Pakistan in cricket, and the entire country lit up in celebration. Celebrities and leaders flooded social media with praise, traditional media turned it into a spectacle and LinkedIn is overflowing with leadership lessons. The cricket team deserves every bit of this recognition.\n\nBut so do the many other athletes who have made India proud with their achievements, yet no one is talking about them.\n\n-Gulveer Singh just became the first Indian to run a 5000m race in under 13 minutes, setting a new national record. A superhuman feat—yet, our timelines remain silent.\n-Pankaj Advani won his 14th Asian gold in snooker and is setting records like a hobby. Barely a mention.\n-Saurav Ghosal came out of retirement and won an international squash title in Sydney. No one noticed.\n-India’s U-21 men’s archery team shattered a world record at the ongoing Asia Cup. Few even realize that India is a powerhouse in this sport.\n\nAnd all of this happened in just the past week.\n\nWe are what we celebrate. If we only cheer for cricket, we will only be a cricketing nation. If we only celebrate one sport, we shouldn’t expect that India will dominate the Olympics. If we want to be a sporting country, we need to start valuing sports beyond cricket. We can’t develop world-class sports talent when our entire system is designed to ignore them.\n\nAttention in India is a monopoly and cricket owns it. And like any monopoly, it strangles competition. A billion people are celebrating one sport while world-class athletes in other sports struggle for recognition. If kids never see champions outside cricket, they never dream beyond cricket. If brands don’t see ROI, they won’t invest. If the media doesn’t cover it, the public won’t care.\n\nThis isn’t just about fairness but survival. Sport is more than entertainment. It is culture, identity, and power.\n\nAnd the power is also in hands of most of us. So next time an Indian athlete wins anything, anywhere, let’s also celebrate them. Post about them. Talk about them. If a billion of us can scream for a six, we can clap for a world and national record.\n\nA sporting nation isn’t built on one game. It’s built on celebrating all champions. Change starts with attention. Where you look is what grows.",

  "text": "Gopi is right. The reality is brutal—less than 1% of aspiring athletes make it big, and even those who do are left with little security once their careers are over. Sports, like startups, have a power law distribution—10% of players make 90% of the money. Everyone else is a statistic.\n\nWe love to read and watch the underdog story—the kid from nowhere who makes it to the top. But that’s survivorship bias. For every one success, there are tens of thousands who trained just as hard but got nothing. The real question is: why does sports have to be a gamble?\n\n If you’re not in the top 1%, you don’t get sponsorships, you don’t have financial security, and once your career ends—usually in your late 20’s or early 30s—you’re left scrambling for what’s next.\n\nIn developed nations, sports is a structured industry. There are leagues, second-tier careers, college scholarships, and post-career pathways. \n\nIf you don’t become an Olympic champion, you can still earn a living as a coach, analyst, trainer, or minor league player. The system doesn’t discard you the moment you’re not in the top 1%.\n\nThe problem isn’t that sports is hard—it’s that failure is absolute. An engineer who fails at a startup can get a job. A failed athlete? They often have nothing. That’s why in most countries without strong sports ecosystems, success in sports correlates with wealth. You can’t afford to be an athlete unless you can afford to lose.\n\nRight now, telling a poor kid to pursue sports is like telling them to buy lottery tickets as an investment strategy. Until we change that, Gopi’s words will remain true. And that’s a failure—not of the athletes, but of the system.\n\nA great sports system doesn’t just create champions—it creates a nation of resilient, disciplined, and competitive people. And that’s the foundation of real development.",

His motivation was the struggles his sister faced growing up.\n\nThis is the side of content creation people rarely see in India. Because it doesn’t go viral. It doesn’t spark outrage or fuel controversy. \n\nIn the past few days, there’s been a lot of noise about content creators-their influence, their controversies. A few loud voices stir outrage, and suddenly, the entire ecosystem of creators is under fire. The attention economy is ruthless- outrage is a currency and algorithms reward volume, not knowledge.\n\nBut the internet remains the last true frontier of leverage. With just a phone and an idea, a single person can achieve what once took institutions, gatekeepers, and millions in capital. It’s a superpower and like all superpowers, it’s all about how we use it.\n\nYes, there’s noise and chaos. But beneath it, there are builders, educators, and creators using this leverage to make the world a little better.\n\nThe internet doesn’t care what we consume or create. But in the long run, we become what we feed our mind. The question isn’t whether content creation is good or bad. \n\nThe question is: what are we using it for. If you want better content, make it.

  "text": "Building a business in preventive health is hard. No one tells you this upfront. I learned it the hard way, first as a founder, now as an investor.\n\nYou’ve chosen the harder game. Not because prevention doesn’t work, but because people don’t pay for it. Most wake up thinking about chai, parathas , deadlines, and school fees. Not long-term health. People today want instant gratification—sugar today, gym tomorrow.\n\nCurative health makes money because illness is urgent. No one postpones a bypass surgery or negotiates an ICU bill. But prevention? Everyone hunts for gym discounts, coupon codes for healthy food and thinks twice before paying for a fitness program.\n\nHospitals & pharma companies thrive because they sell relief from suffering. And suffering is a guaranteed market—prevention is not.\n\nThat’s why venture money chases curative health—it scales fast with clear unit economics, solving problems people can’t ignore. Asking someone to eat better, sleep more, and exercise for a payoff 5–10 years later is like selling an FD over a lottery ticket. So accept this reality and build accordingly.\n\nYet, prevention is the hardest problem and the biggest untaped opportunity.\n#1 Healthcare in India will shift to prevention-not because people suddenly care, but because not caring is becoming too expensive. \n\n#2 Your market isn’t TAM, it’s WTM (willing-to-pay market). Everyone should care about health, but few will pay for it.To go mass-market, make it cheaper than chai and as seamless as WhatsApp.\n\n#3 If you’re selling prevention, reposition it. People don’t buy prevention. They buy status, performance, and convenience. Make it aspirational & competitive.\n\n#4 Trust in health isn’t built overnight. People won’t change their habits because you raised venture money. You’re in the business of delayed gratification. That means slow &sustainable growth.\n\n#5 If your product doesn’t make people healthier or keep them engaged long-term, the number of app downloads doesn't matter. Focus on retention, real outcomes and revenue—not GMV, DAUs or metrics to make a pitch deck look good. \n\nIf you can do this, you won’t just build a business—you’ll change how India thinks about health. And that’s worth building for.",

  "text": "We've invested in 35+ health companies in India and these are some observations on what works (and doesn't). If you're a founder building in health and planning to raise funds, these notes are for you.\n\n1) Trust is the only moat in preventive health. In healthcare, people don’t buy products. They buy trust. Preventive health is not an impulse purchase. Unlike sick-care, preventive health requires behavior change, which Indians resist unless they deeply trust the source.\nSo, before you raise money, ask yourself:\n-Do people trust you enough to pay upfront, or do you need constant marketing?\n-Is there real evidence that your intervention works—or is it just another diet plan, gadget, or wellness promise?\nIf you don’t have a strong, organic trust loop, raising VC money won’t help. Money can buy ads, but it can’t buy credibility.\n\n2) Distribution is your Intellectual Property. In preventive health, distribution is the product. Without it, you’re just another marketing agency. India is filled with \"next-gen\" fitness apps, ayurveda solutions, and longevity programs—most fail because they don’t solve the hardest problem: distribution.\nYou should only raise money when:\n-You have a low-CAC, high-retention acquisition channel—word of mouth, organic virality, or a B2B partner who does the heavy lifting. \n-You don’t rely on Google/Facebook ads to acquire users. \nMost preventive health startups mistake marketing for product. \n\n3) Your real product is the outcome. Preventive health isn’t about engagement, it’s about results. Indians don’t pay for health advice—they pay for outcomes. If your model is content-based or habit-driven but lacks measurable outcomes, you will struggle to justify raising any money. \nBefore you raise money, prove:\n-Measurable outcomes: What % of users improved their health? \n- Behavior stickiness: How many users are still with you after 6 months? Is this a short-term motivation spike or a lasting habit?\n-Revenue beyond one-time purchases: Subscription, long-term engagement, or ecosystem lock-in.\nThe worst mistake you can make is optimising for likes, shares, time spent,  instead of real-world health results.\n\n4) You should only raise money when you’ve proven at least one of these:\nDistribution: You’ve hacked a scalable way to acquire patients/customers without burning money on ads.\nClinical Efficacy: Your product has regulatory approval, proven clinical outcomes, or strong signals of delivering outcomes. \nNetwork Effects: Your product becomes more valuable as more people use it.\n\n5) In India, you’re not fighting incumbents. You’re fighting inertia. Unlike in the U.S., where insurers or employers drive adoption, in India: \n-Hospitals are conservative and slow-moving. Selling to them takes years.\n-Doctors are overworked. Adoption needs to be frictionless.\n-Consumers pay out of pocket. If you need to educate them, your CAC will kill you.\n\nHope these notes are useful. Good luck to all building in Health in India.",

  "text": "We have two choice to fix air pollution issue. Either we argue, debate, and wait for someone else to fix it. Some government intervention or corporate responsibility. That’s a passive way to live.\n\nOr start having conversations on how each of us can contribute our part right away. 33,000 people die in India, annually from to air pollution in just 10 Indian cities.\n\n#1 Start at home and get an AQI monitor Measure your air and know what you and your kids are breathing. Use air purifiers. Create a clean space for sleeping and breathing. Insist your workplace and kids school to install a monitor and ask them publish the AQI regularly. \n\n#2 Stay fit. Your lungs, heart, and immune system are your best defense. Regular exercise, clean eating, and strong respiratory health will make you more resilient to pollution’s effects. A weak body suffers more.\n\n#3 If every school, apartment complex, and office block planted more trees, we wouldn’t just improve air quality, we’d create cooler, cleaner neighborhoods. Plant trees not because it’s trendy. Because it’s basic math. More green, cleaner air.\n\n#4 If construction is happening near your home, insist on dust control measures—sprinkling water, covering debris, and using dust barriers. Pollution from construction is a silent killer, but it’s preventable.\n\n#5 Avoid unnecessary travel in high pollution zones. Protect your lungs like you would protect your wealth. Mask wisely. If the air is bad, wear a proper N95 when outdoors. Not for fear, but for protection.\n\nNo one is coming to save you. The world is run by inertia. The system will take decades to correct itself. Your children & parents don’t have decades.\n\nThe air we breathe is the first gift of life, and the last we’ll surrender.",

These are people who haven't written a single line of code in their lives. \n\nA country doesn't become a technology leader through celebrity endorsements or political speeches. India will never be a technology powerhouse if we parade technology as an accessory. Real AI innovation doesn’t come from celebrity panels—it comes from builders. PhDs, engineers, founders—people who write code, build models, and deploy systems at scale.\n\nThe US and China didn’t lead in AI because of influencer summits. They did it through university labs, open-source contributions, and startup founders building from first principles. We need to build an ecosystem to listen and learn from builders. \n\nTechnology isn’t a spectator sport. If India wants to lead, we must put real builders at the center of the conversation.",

But waiting for motivation is a trap. Set rules. No junk food in the house. Stock the kitchen with real food.\n\n#4 The mainstream food industry is a trap. Ads target kids. It’s all designed for short-term profit at the cost of lifelong disease. Don’t wait for policy changes.

No matter what else you do, you should figure out this first.\n\nThe decision whether to grow slowly, organically and profitably or to have a big bang with fast growth, lots of capital and burn.\n\nI ignored making that decision when i was building. Irony is, I'm now reminding others when they come for funding :)\n\nValuation and funding are just the shiny toys. If you really want to play, focus on your customers and making a profit.

My job as an investor is to invest in companies but I will tell you, venture capital is a hammer and not every company is a nail. Not every company needs to chase VC dollars. The narrative of ‘scale or die’ is often a false choice.\n\nThe goal of a business isn’t to conquer or collapse. It should be to build something that lasts, something you love, without chasing unwanted vanity metrics. A business that pays its own bills, funds its own dreams, and builds loyal customers. That’s freedom. That’s success.\n\nVC money comes with trade offs- expectations, pressure, and often a loss of control. But all businesses don’t need to play that game. The first principles of a business is to build a self sustaining engine of solving customer problems , driven by purpose and not external cash or valuation . \n\nSome businesses should be free to explore, to experiment, to create without permission.\nSometimes, the bravest thing a founder can do is say no to money and yes to independence. \n\nNot every entrepreneur dreams of an exit.

  "text": "We meet atleast 20 companies every month building solutions for longevity. Billions of dollars are being spent. Met Bryan Jhonson who spends $2million every year on his own longevity. Sharing some observations from an investor and an health enthusiast perspective for India. \n\n#1 Everyone loves the idea of a pill or device that adds 50 years to life. But longevity is 80% lifestyle and 20% intervention. Companies chasing the 20% often overpromise and underdeliver. Don’t exploit people’s fear of death or disease to sell products & supplements leading to skepticism and distrust.\n\n#2 Blood tests and wearables measure everything now—glucose, cortisol, telomeres. But data without actionable insights is just noise. A longer life needs meaningful action, not just analytics. Don’t over emphasise on biomarkers without a feedback loop to fix it. Build tools that have clear clinical and user adoption pathways.\n\n#3 Investors want quick ROI, but longevity isn’t a sprint, it’s a marathon. Companies chasing valuations as a metric often neglect the slow, foundational research required. Your core product will accelerate your valuation if you deliver outcome. Don’t promise timelines that ignore the inherent long cycles of research, trials, and regulatory approvals.\n\n#4 The key isn’t to stop aging but to improve healthspan—living well until the end. Companies prioritizing quality over quantity of life are the real winners. Build systems on aging as a process to address muscle loss or inflammation rather than waiting for chronic disease onset.\n\n#5 You can’t engineer longevity if people won’t adopt the solutions. Companies that understand habit formation and human psychology will create an IP. The future of longevity isn’t in more tech but in accessible, scalable solutions—better sleep, balanced nutrition, and community support. These “boring” fixes will outlast flashy innovations.\n\n#6 Women experience aging differently but are often overlooked in longevity-focused research. Focus on women’s health. Also longevity studies need to be diverse. We can’t be using datasets primarily from high-income countries and build solutions for people in low and middle-income populations.\n\n#7 Don’t associate longevity with celebrity faces to generate PR. This will lack substance and meaningful validation.\n\nRemember, people don’t just want to live longer. They want to live better. Focus on delivering that as your metric. \n\nIf you’re building something meaningful in this space, happy to exchange notes.",

  "text": "Indians want to eat healthy and companies want to make healthier alternatives. But both customers and brands are often confused.  Health food is a $30B market in India and we meet atleast 20 companies every week. My last post on Indians eating protein got a lot of attention. So here is a playbook for brands, entrepreneurs & startups making food as nutrition to consider.\n\n#1- Sell simplicity, not superiority. Protein is not a luxury, it’s a necessity. Stop marketing it like it’s only for bodybuilders or fitness fanatics. The simpler your message, the broader your audience.\n\n#2- Educate, don’t exploit- Most Indians don’t know how much protein , carb or fibre they need, let alone where to get it. Be the brand that empowers with knowledge, not fear. Create tools, guides, or calculators that simplify nutrient requirements for different age groups, lifestyles, and budgets. Education creates trust, and trust builds loyalty.\n\n#3- Respect local wisdom- Stop chasing western trends and start celebrating Indian staples. Align your messaging with cultural relevance—it resonates deeper than imported fads.\n\n#4- Focus on affordability and accessibility- If your product costs more than an average meal, you’re solving a problem for the few, not the many. Create products that cater to the masses, especially rural and low-income communities. Affordability isn’t just ethical—it’s scalable.\n\n#5-Champion the underserved - Protein or carbs isn’t just for athletes or gym-goers. It’s crucial for children, pregnant women, and the elderly and they often are left out of the conversation. Tailor your products and campaigns to serve them, and you’ll stand out as a brand with purpose, not just profits.\n\n#6- Break the high-protein Halo - A “high-protein” claim shouldn’t be your only story. Focus on the overall quality of your product—minimal additives, real ingredients, and transparent labeling. If your protein bar has more sugar than a laddoo, you’re part of the problem, not the solution.\n\n#7- Decommoditize the narrative - Don’t just sell protein or fibre—sell the idea of a healthier India. Be the brand that shifts the conversation from “how much protein you eat” to “how balanced your diet is.” Make protein part of the bigger picture, not the entire story.\n\n#8-Make nutrient consumption a Public Good- Don’t just sell specific nutrient products; create ecosystems that make nutrient accessible and affordable for everyone. Collaborate with local governments to integrate protein-rich foods into public programs like midday meals and ration systems. You’ll build long-term demand while addressing a systemic health challenge.\"\n\nMore notes continued in the comment section below.",

  "text": "Indians are not eating enough protein. This narrative has been making rounds for the past few years amplified by fitness influencers, nutritionists and brands. At Rainmatter by Zerodha, we’ve invested in ten companies making different form factors of protein consumption with the hope that we need a balanced ecosystem for nutrition. \n\nMy general view is that the the protein story in India is becoming less of a nutrient and more of an identity. It’s what you consume to signal you’re part of the “aware” and “fit” crowd. This is what i've been observing. \n\n#1- In urban India, protein powders and supplements have become the new status symbol. You’re not really working out unless you’re Instagramming your shaker bottle. It’s less about nutrition and more about validation.\n\n#2- Protein enthusiasts often villainize carbs and demonise other macro nutrients as if they’re the root of all health problems. India thrives on a carbohydrate-rich culture—rotis, rice, dosas—but demonizing carbs overlooks balance. You need energy to sprint, not just to squat.\n\n#3- The idea that protein comes only from a powder tub priced like a luxury item is flawed. Whole food are getting sidelined in favor of trendy solutions.\n\n#4- India might be the only country that has the highest cultural protein diversity. Traditional diets are already protein rich- lentils, curd, paneer, fish or chicken are ingrained in our cuisine. \n\n#5 -Urban India is obsessed over consuming protein within 30 minutes of a workout, treating the post-gym meal as sacred. I think it’s a “Protein Timing” Myth. Your body isn’t checking the clock. it’s about overall daily intake.\n\n#6- The conversation around protein in India is hyper-focused on gym-goers and athletes. Meanwhile, the elderly—who desperately need more protein to preserve muscle mass and bone health are left out of the discussion entirely.\n\nLook, protein is a tool, not a trophy. It’s one piece of a larger puzzle—like building a house with bricks but ignoring the foundation. Somewhere along the way, we lost the nuance and turned nutrition into a black-and-white debate.\n\nEat more protein, sure. But do it with purpose, not propaganda. Because at the end of the day, nutrition isn’t about being part of a trend. It’s about being part of a better life.\n\nIf you're entrepreneur building solutions in this space or an enthusiast of this category, i've some thoughts on what should be and can be done to build an ecosystem that benefits all. Will share some notes tomorrow.",

  "text": "Hi Albinder, this is a much needed and important service. Cheering for you and team to bring impact. We met a bunch of companies in emergency care category for supporting them via Rainmatter. \n\nSharing notes from what we observed. Hoping it’s useful to your team working on this project. \n\nFirst, ambulance services in India aren’t a technology problem or even a logistics problem. They’re a coordination and trust problem. The best service won’t be the one that arrives the fastest but the one that creates a system people trust to save them when it matters.\n\n1) Most companies we met obsess over response times, aiming for unrealistic goals like “X” minute arrivals. speed is critical but treatment initiation time and survival rates are more important metric. Faster doesn’t always mean better outcomes; preparedness matters more.\n\n2) There’s a race to equip ambulances with cutting-edge tech, assuming it’s a game-changer. But a well-trained paramedic with basic tools can often save more lives than an undertrained individual with a ventilator they barely know how to use. Unfortunately, in India skill training is still an underrated aspect of operating. \n\n3) The belief that more ambulances solve the problem is misguided. In more metro cities, poor traffic management and a lack of awareness about yielding to ambulances neutralize fleet size advantages. But you guys have the brand  authority to create awareness and educate people on basic road etiquette’s . Smaller companies can’t do what you can. \n\n4) Pre arrival communication. Many lives can be saved by guiding the bystanders or family members on basic first aid before the ambulance arrives. Simple steps like positioning a patient correctly can buy precious time.\n\nOperating an ambulance service in India is about optimizing for chaos—a system where traffic, infrastructure, and trust deficits compete with time-sensitive medical needs. Success lies not in being faster, shinier, or cheaper but in being smarter, simpler, and more human.\n\nGood luck to you and team to make real impact with this service. Really want this service to succeed. \n\nAnd if the team wants to collaborate with the operators /founders who are already solving for this, can connect to the startups we have met.",

  "text": "We reviewed 800+ health startups in India this year. Met 200+ founders in person. These are entrepreneurs building across health tech, fitness, nutrition, software for doctors, diagnostics, healthy food, longevity, sports, elder care, women health, lifestyle management & more. \n\nThis is a long post on everything we've seen and observed in 2024 at Rainmatter by Zerodha. If you're an entrepreneur, investor of health enthusiast, this is for you. \n\n1) There is a telemedicine fatigue- The post-pandemic boom in telemedicine has plateaued. While accessibility improved, sustainable consumer engagement still remains a challenge due to weak doctor-patient relationship and lack of differentiation. Patients want emotional and personalised engagement. Most companies are overusing AI in the disguise of scale. Opportunity is to solve for depth (chronic disease management) rather than breadth (generic consultation marketplaces).\n\n2) Overload of premium fitness and wellness Apps- Apps targeting high-income urban users are oversaturated. Most startups overestimate the willingness of users to pay for digital fitness content. Opportunity is to focus on communities, hybrid models (offline + online), or affordable mass-market solutions. India is still not ready for Peloton content. We breathe YouTube.\n\n3) Selling SaaS tools to Doctors- Doctors in India are notoriously price-sensitive. Most SaaS products fail due to limited willingness to adopt technology and low ROI visibility. Maybe companies should emphasise on simplicity and immediate value delivery. Job of a Doctor is to deliver treatment to patients and not learn how to use software. Need to humanise software in primary and secondary health care\n\n4) Longevity buzz- Longevity startups sound exciting but cater to a niche. Everyone loves the idea of a pill or device that adds 50 years to life. But longevity is 80% lifestyle and 20% intervention. Startups chasing the 20% often overpromise and underdeliver. Without a strong clinical base or mass appeal, they will remain limited to aspirational urban elites. Opportunity is in integrating into broader wellness solutions rather than standalone ventures\n\n5) Healthy food & nutrition- Overcrowding of “healthy snacks” and “superfoods” where differentiation is low and margins are squeezed by Quick commerce and logistics. Maybe companies should move beyond buzzwords like “organic” or “keto” and solve for authentic, local, and culturally aligned nutrition. India is a country of a million palates\n\n6) Chronic disease management- Diabetes, hypertension, Weight loss and mental health requires long-term engagement and behaviour modification. While the space is competitive, there is room for solutions that prioritise patient journeys and retention over time. Driving outcome has to be the focus. Everything else is a vanity feature that doesn’t earn trust. Paid marketing will get expensive customers who won’t stick around\n\nSharing the remaining notes in the comments section. Read below",

At Rainmatter we are constantly finding ways to cheer for the ecosystem. Share stories and experiences about most companies and founders we meet.

It’s that one person who believes in you. That person could be a family member, a friend, or even a stranger.\n\nFor me, that person was Nithin Kamath. He had no reason to believe in me. I was a nobody in the startup world—no background in high-tech companies, no premier academic credentials. I knew literally no one in the startup ecosystem who could vouch for me. But he took a bet on me. One cold email in 2019 led to a meaningful relationship that has shaped my journey.\n\nAnd he didn’t just bet on me once—he did it twice. First, as an investor, and later with the opportunity to build Rainmatter Health.\n\nSo, don’t let rejection from investors define your passion or commitment. Just wait for that one person to show up. They will.",

  "text": "Entrepreneurs- if you’re building products to help people stay healthy this meetup is for you. Rainmatter is a venture fund supporting companies making products that helps Indians to stay healthy, mentally and physically.\n\nThis is the first time we’re doing a meetup in Bangalore. The last two was in Delhi and Mumbai and it was was super fun.\n\nThis is going to be casual gathering to meet founders, builders and creators building solutions in healthcare. Don’t expect panel sessions or any gyaan by experts :). The real value is in meeting other builders and exchanging notes from their experiences. You could be building in nutrition, health tech, sports or fitness. We can use the time to exchange notes and brainstorm on any problem statement you've in your startup/product. We will share our thoughts and observations of having invested in 25+ companies in health. \n\nDate : 8th November. Exact venue will be sent post signup. \n\nRegister here to attend the event : https://lu.ma/x1r4hd4m\n\nIf you know any founder in Bangalore who could come, pls share it with them. \nSee you soon :)",

  "text": "Priceless words by Jeff Bezos. \nThe difference between gifts and choices. Cleverness is a gift; kindness is a choice. Gifts are easy—they’re given after all. Choices can be hard. In the end, we are our choices.\n\nThis is something that’s super important for young people to understand, and for parents to preach to young people. It’s really easy for a talented young person to take pride in their gifts: ‘I’m really athletic,’ or ‘I’m really smart,’ or ‘I’m really good at math.’ That’s fine. You should celebrate your gifts. You should be happy. But you can’t be proud of them. What you can be proud of is your choices.”\n\nDid you work hard? That’s a choice.\nDid you study hard? That’s a choice.\nDid you practice? That’s a choice.\n\nThe people who excel combine gifts and hard work, and the hard work part is a choice.\n\nwe are our choices.",

There is a general consensus amongst people that most young Indians are wasting their time. I think we need to allow them to be more curious and risk taking. Encourage them to question everything - what’s considered normal and approach life with an endless curiosity. That's the only way to build a generation that will drive the future of India.

  "text": "There are some untold realities of healthcare industry that you will only understand through your own experiences. Learning will come at the cost of suffering. But you should know this- \n\n- The more complex the treatment, the more you should question its necessity.\n- People will sell magic diets because the truth is too boring: eat less, move more.\n-Health trends are made to be sold, not to work.\n-People will often dress common sense as breakthrough science.\n-The more a product claims to fix all your problems, the more likely it’s fixing none.\n-In fitness, ‘results in 30 days’ is just code for ‘we will be back to sell you more.\n-Doctors aren’t always wrong, but they rarely say ‘I don’t know.’\n-The healthiest advice costs nothing, but people pay for complexity to avoid discomfort.\n\t\nRemember, healthcare thrives on your ignorance. The real risk in healthcare is trusting someone who profits when you don’t understand.",

  "text": "Millions of people in India will get inspired if they meet them. You may not know this, but some of our para-athletes are PhDs, IITians, IAS officer, farmers, entrepreneurs, & world champions.\n\nLast week i met our Paralympians and never experienced goosebumps and teary eyes for such a long time in my life. What they’ve achieved isn’t just about medals; it’s something far deeper and more profound. You have to meet them to truly understand that. Each one of them has reasons to play sports that is beyond imagination to many of us. \n\nIncredible work by Viren Rasquinha , Neha Aggarwal Sharma OLY and the entire team of OGQ  for being on the side of these para  athletes for many years. \n\nWhenever I post about supporting sports, many here ask what they can do. Here’s what you can- \n1. Read about these para-athletes and watch their videos. Share their stories with your kids and family. Follow them on Social Media, so you can recognise them in real life. And if you ever meet them take a selfie. They don’t expect this but they deserve attention from all of us. Only then brands and sponsors will recognise them. \n\n2. Encourage your company to support sports foundations through CSR . Organizations like OGQ,  GoSports Foundation & Simply Sport Foundation are doing impactful work to support these athletes & para-athletes and need backing from individuals and companies to continue their efforts. \n\nIf you don’t click the like button on a cricketer’s post, it won’t matter to them. But if you like and share stories of these para-athletes, it can make a world of difference for them.\n\nIt just takes 6gms of gold to lift the worth of a nation. That’s the slogan for OGQ.",

  "text": "Have met over 600+ healthcare startups this year at Rainmatter. These are my general observations of the sector in 2024 so far. An investor & health enthusiast perspective. \n\nRemember, these are observations and not opinions.  If you’re a builder, I'm always keen to exchange notes.\n\n1) Health tech needs maturing – The novelty phase of tech meets health is over and the focus should be on driving outcomes to the user.\n\n2) Preventive health is gaining traction – More startups are focused on preventive solutions.\n\n3) Nutrition personalisation is heating up – Companies are going beyond generic consulting and leveraging DNA, microbiome, or other personal data for nutrition recommendations.\n\n4) UPI for health not yet in India- ABDM use cases haven't seen much adoption.\n\n5) Wearables are no longer the star – Smartwatches and rings are still strong but are considered table stakes. Consumers want something that tells “why” and not limited to “what”.\n\n6) Corporate wellness is an overrated market – With rising mental health issues, stress, and burnout in the workforce, B2B wellness solutions ideally should show promise. But there isn’t adoption from corporates.\n\n7) The “biohacking” trend is niche but growing –longevity startups are speculative but hot.  Increasing interest in biohacking protocols (sleep optimization, anti ageing etc.). But the market is niche and often hard to validate scientifically unless clinical protocols are done.\n\n8) Consumer trust in health supplements is dwindling – The supplement industry lacks regulation and transparency and this has eroded trust amongst consumers. Brands are focusing on science-backed products.\n\n9) AI in healthcare – Many are bullish on AI’s potential to revolutionise diagnostics, patient care, and drug discovery, but deployment in clinical settings is slow and capital-intensive.\n\n10) Mental health is booming – Digital mental health startups, especially those offering therapy, coaching, or CBT solutions are seeing adoptions but differentiation is becoming a challenge in a crowded market.\n\n11) Community-driven fitness – Social, community-oriented fitness solutions still have potential if done right especially those blending real-world interactions with digital offerings.\n\n12) CAC is a challenge for D2C health brands – Brands are facing rising customer acquisition costs often with no sustainable GTM.\n\n13) Hybrid health businesses are scaling better – Companies combining digital and physical services have better scope of scaling fast.\n\n14) Telehealth plateaued – The initial excitement around telehealth has subsided for both consumers and investors.\n\n15) Health marketplaces have no moat – Platforms connecting consumers with healthcare providers or wellness services are overrated with no clear moat to grow.\n\nThere are more thoughts on this. Because of the word limit on Linkedin , can't post the remaining here. Read the whole list on https://lnkd.in/g-CTY4zC",

  "text": "Running is one of the most accessible forms of exercise to stay fit. Not everyone needs to do a marathon but a few days of running in a week along with strength training is a good way to improve cardiovascular health.\n\nWe’ve a bunch of runners in our team at Rainmatter and Zerodha and I've personally benefited a lot from the sport. We were discussing internally how we can get more Indians to run?\nAnd then we met Vikas Singh who is building fitpage and he invited us for a group run. It was good to see people from different age group and gender show up on a Sunday morning and enjoy the community experience of running together.\n\nThere are more than 3 million active runners in India today and we think there is an opportunity to create an ecosystem to get more people fit through this form of participatory sport.\n\nAt Rainmatter by Zerodha we are excited to announce our investment and partnership with fitpage. Through their science backed coaching programs and running events they are bringing more people outdoors to enjoy walking, and running.\n\nOn a personal note, my wish is to see an Indian runner finish in the top 10 at the Olympics someday. I hope to see some of you at some marathon event soon :) \n\nLink to our investment post in the comments",

The era of longevity has come a full circle.\n\nMost people start seeing their health deteriorate in their 30s & beyond.\n\nBecoming unhealthy is not an event. It is a process. Like losing money, losing your health is rarely caused by one thing going wrong. Usually, it is a series of ignorant and wrong doings.\n\nNo matter how much money you have, how many ESOPs you earned, how great your company’s valuation soared. \n\nIf you can’t take a walk on a random Wednesday morning or eat your breakfast without checking emails.\n\nYou’re NOT wealthy.",

  "text": "I think the definition of being healthy and looking fit is a modern-day confusion caused by social media. Don’t know why people fail to understand that being fit is not equal to being healthy. \n\nMost people believe being healthy and being fit are one and the same. It’s not. They are not synonymous and are distinct states of physical well-being. \n\nBeing fit means your ability to perform physical activities like endurance, stamina, strength, & speed. These are a set of attributes that people have or train to develop to perform a physical activity. \n\nBeing healthy is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being. Your physiological and internal biological systems should be working in harmony. \n\nWe often look at athletes or movie stars as fit and healthy. But most times they are not. Going to a gym or doing a run doesn’t get you a heart attack or stroke. Overdoing it might. So do everything in the right proportion. \n\nBeing fit can contribute to overall health and yet it's possible for someone to be physically fit but still experience health issues due to poor nutrition, stress, lack of sleep, or underlying medical conditions. \n\nWe all live a hectic life and are exposed to stress and distractions all the time. It’s more important for people who prioritize fitness to balance it with healthy living. Stress + rest = growth. \n\n1- Get your blood tests done at regular intervals.\n2- Consult your physician. Not your WhatsApp friends.\n3- Seek help from a qualified nutritionist and trainer. Not Instagram or YouTube influencers.\n4- Spend less time doing commentary on Whatsapp groups and more with your family and friends.  \n\nThe progress in your fitness or health is the gap between your desire and commitment. Don’t over burden it with confusion.",

There is a special emotion in seeing Indian flag on global sports map.\n\nIn all my conversations with professional athletes, the common request has been for consistent support for their pursuits—not just financial, but also cheering for their smaller wins and being on their side when they don't make it to the podium. \n\nIndia has the sports talent but we also need a support system and processes to guide and anchor these athletes continuously. We are excited to partner with the GoSports foundation, who are doing this and more towards athlete development and support.\n\nYesterday, we met a few Olympians and Paralympians, and all of them had a common goal- to make India proud.

I’m confused on what to share when people ask me for guidance to make a career in venture world.\n\nBecoming an investor and continuing to be a useful investor are two different skills.\n\nYou can scout founders and read pitch decks as a young VC. But to become a useful investor you need empathy, patience and ask the right questions. This skill is a muscle that is only developed if you have built something in the past.\n\nI’ve been an entrepreneur for most part of my life. Did many mistakes while figuring how to build a business. \n\nNow, I’m on the other side cheering entrepreneurs learning from their mistakes and still figuring how to do business :)\n\nSo, go and build things and be useful.

She is a Ph.D. in cancer stem cell and works as a clinical lecturer on chronic liver diseases. \n\nShe became the first women ever to complete the 100mile plus Barkley marathon. It's one of the most difficult and cruel ultra-marathon race in the world. 160 km race, 5 laps of 32 km each inside a forest. No navigation & no support.

  "text": "Last week i completed 18 months being on other the side of entrepreneurship. Being a partner and cheerleader to entrepreneurs. I was not engineered for this role and continue to feel stretched between a builder and an investor. \n\nEvery 6months, i share my learnings from this role to my team at Rainmatter by Zerodha. This is what i shared with them last week. \n\n1. The most effective way to critique something is by creating an improved version. It’s easier for investors to pass judgments on founders but much harder to do what they do. Critiques are overrated. Being useful is underrated.\n\n2. Founders teach you more than you teach them. Gotta accept it. Despite being a founder in the past, the drive of new founders I meet constantly reminds how much more there is to learn and unlearn.\n\n3. Finding the founder who has the skin in the game is hard. But those who have the most to lose are a better bet to take than those whose life won’t change even if they lose everything.\n\n4. Slow progress is still a million times better than no progress.\n\n5. If you get an update from the founder and you are not asking the right questions, you are learning nothing.\n\n6. Founders with very high expectations usually have very low patience.\n\n7. Rejection can be delivered in many ways and will often hurt the founder. But a rejection with a reason & feedback on what they are building is better than a diplomatic no.\n\n8. It is impossible to be helpful and opinionated at the same time.\n\n9. We can either trust our gut or intellect to make a decision. It’s a choice between being happy or being right. Figuring each is hard work.\n\n10. The paradox of autonomy. I’d imagined being a startup investor would give me control over my time, only to find myself constantly on the clock dealing with founders and their emotions at all hours.\n\n11. Asking for company updates means you care about the business. Asking for the founder’s wellbeing means you care about them. Finding the right balance will make a true cheerleader.\n\n12. The number of times “I” is used instead of “We” on emails will tell if the founder cares about their team.\n\n13. There is a thin line between being bold and being reckless. We can predict it but can’t anticipate it.\n\n14. The most important metric for an investor to the founder should be “being useful”. This is what Nithin was for me when I was a founder.\n\nI wanted to make this list count till 18 but this is all i've got :)\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/gP6i-xtw",

  "text": "There is something about Sports that drives emotions. Even if you don’t play it. Even if you don’t follow it. \n\n29yo wrestler fought two battles. Against a dominant and some say an unbeatable opponent. But that was just a physical fight. She came here fighting millions of naysayers and critics whom did a lot to pull her down. She had a torn ligament. A lower weight category. And she is the first Indian now to make to an Olympics finals. That’s Vinesh Phogat for you. She is not done yet. \n\nA 22yo shuttler becomes first Indian to get to Olympics semi finals. He gave a good fight but couldn’t come home with a medal. The coach feels, he could have done more on the court. But people are rooting for this kid. That’s Lakshya Sen for you.\n\n15 men went on a mission to reclaim the lost glory of Indian hockey. Made it to semi finals  of Olympics and fought a hard battle. They couldn’t get through to a gold but stirred a lot of emotions in a country who had forgotten the sport. That’s Indian national hockey team for you. They are not done yet. \n\nThere are numerous more emotions.\n\nThere is one thing you all should do. Tell your kids these stories of grit and resilience. Show them these emotions. They will learn from real sports. Movies can wait.\n\nA country is built on the back of many such athletes. We are animals of emotions.",

  "text": "Met a 65yo aspiring entrepreneur this week. A grandmom to four kids who wants to solve a problem most in this current generation maybe facing. \n\nHer problem statement: In India every minute 51 babies are born. That means 26,805,600 couples become parent every year. That's 26.8 million couples. Parenting is not a skill that is taught and is a stressful journey for the first 5 years. Especially for working couples with no support.\n\nSolution: A therapy/counselling service just focused on new parents. They are stressed and confused most of the time. They need someone to guide them and tell what not to do than what to do. \n\nHer competitive edge : Mother to three and grandmom to four kids. I can’t create an app but can attempt to create mindful parents. This is what she said :) \n\nBeing an entrepreneur late in life can be a superpower. Because you've outlived the fads and fanciness. Now, it's all about substance and genuine awareness. Experience and wisdom are the dividends of a well-lived life.\n\nSharing the first message she sent me on Twitter in the comments 😊\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/gz7TJyxi",

But there is something which often gets missed and ignored in excitement. \n\nSports is the biggest school for life lessons. Each one of them and countless more athletes goes through this in their life every day. \n\nDon't judge them for the medals they win. Celebrate them for the effort they have put in to reach here. It takes a special kind to do that. \n\nHow we behave today when they win or loose will determine the future of sports in our country. Millions of kids will either start playing sports and dream  being an olympian. Or will never pursue it. \n\nThis is the best time to show your kids the true lessons of sports. Everything we do now will define the future of sports in India. \n\nLets go 🇮🇳  #paris2024",

They were not the typical startup founders talking AI & tech.\n\nSpent 1hr+ together and not once they spoke about market potential, competition or business strategy. They were obsessed with the problem and how their solution solves for it. Autism is the world’s most common developmental disorder in children. Yet big healthcare providers are not focused enough to solve for that. \n\nWhy will people come to you, i asked? Mother said- \"My younger daughter had autism and I trained myself as a speech language therapist to provide care to my own daughter. My goal is to make mothers, their child's best therapist and hospitals don't want to do that\". \n\nEntrepreneurs who solve for their own problems with relentless passion are unstoppable.",

  "text": "If you are new to exercising or thinking to get started. There is an unspoken truth which you should know about fitness routines. \n\nThis applies if you are going to a gym, yoga , meditate or want to get out and run. \n\nThe first workout in the gym will be hard.\nThe first run on the road will be hard.\nThe first 2 mins of meditation will be hard. \nAdaptions take time. Recovery will be slow .\n\nAnd there will be a constant internal debate- why the hell I’m doing this again. \nIt’s boring. It’s not easy. \nEveryone struggles. I struggle. \n\nThen slowly, fitness compounds. \nWeek after week.\nSet short goals. \nAnd you will get meaningful progress.\nHard workouts will give a sense of achievement. Easy workouts will become enjoyable. \n\nAccept that there is no hack to fitness. \nConsistency will shrink the gap between the goal and progress\nJust show up every day. It's boring but the gains will come as compounding benefits.\n\nFitness training is just learning to be bored while you're hurting. And finding pleasure in the small gains.\n\nTook me 6years to reinvent the different me. \nIt was slow and boring. But here I am.",

Burning out by overworking. \n7) Twisting my values to fit into industry trends I’ve outgrown.\n8) Refusing to accept the reality of my startup.

  "text": "India plays cricket. And cricket makes money. Can that money be used to fuel other sports? \n\nBCCI earned 16,875 crore($2billion) last year. And it has 30 players under active contract. \n\nThese 30 players are collectively paid 88 crore as salary annually. Ofcourse they earn in mutiples outside of this pay. \n\nSo, there is a massive amount of surplus money that the BCCI has. Even after their work expenses. \n\nIndian government allocated 3396 crore last year as sports budget. And we still have Olympic players who are struggling to meet their expenses. Some don’t have money to travel to tournaments. \n\nImagine if the surplus money from one organisation could be used to fuel and support talent of other sports. \n\nIt’s a wishful thinking. But we have to find ways to get support to other deserving athletes. We’ve so much potential.",

If you want to build a company, you’ve just one very important decision to make. \n\nNo matter what else you do, you should figure out this first. You don't have to go to an accelerator, incubator or a VC for this. \n\nThe decision whether to grow slowly, organically and profitably or to have a big bang with fast growth, lots of capital and burn. \n\nI ignored making that decision when i was building. Irony is, I'm now reminding others when they come for funding :) \n\nValuation and funding are just the shiny toys. If you really want to play, focus on your customers and making a profit.

China won 634 medals in 32 years.\n\nIndia's sports budget last year was 3397 crore. China spent 26,240 crore. We spend 3 paisa per capita per day on sports. And China spends 6 rupees. That’s 200 times more than us.\n\nBoth countries have similar population size. Yet India is the lowest in the world on medals per capita. \n\nWe may be brilliant in cricket. But if we've to be a sporting country, we've to spend and support other sports. Watch and celebrate other sports and athletes just the way we do for cricket. We have a lot of talent and potential in other sports to win medals. \n\nGovernment may do their work. But we've to also chip in. If you work in a corporate ask your CSR team to support sports and other athletes. Less than 2% of CSR spends are on sports. Consider other athletes in your marketing campaigns. They have a story to share. \n\nAt Rainmatter by Zerodha we will do our part. Hope you will do yours. \nAnd encourage kids around you to play more sports.",

  "text": "Bring a bunch of founders under one roof, let them talk to each other, give no gyaan. And magic will happen. Last Friday was this. \nDid an impromptu Health Founders meet-up in Delhi last Friday. 180+ people signed up. Could only admit 40 due to space limitations. All of them showed up and few brought their co-founders along.\n\nI thought events and meet-ups were in abundance. Maybe 5-10 people will turn up. But 50 founders were hanging out for 4 hrs on a Friday evening. And all passionate about health and building products to make Indians healthy. \n\nThere was no speech, no panel, no agenda. \nBut entrepreneurs have an innate ability to communicate. So they all started talking to each other. Figured that networking is overrated. But a space to have unfiltered conversations and be your authentic is underrated. \n\nSome got new customers.\nSome met their customers who were using their products. \nSome got offer to share the office space.\nSome validated their new product ideas.\nSome established new partnerships. \nLot of questions on why, what and how. \nAnd a few made their funding pitch. Founder preamble you know :) \nThere was learning and a some unlearning. \n\nApologies for people we couldn’t admit. There was a genuine space limitation. \nIt was an experiment and i dint expect this much response. \n\nAt Rainmatter our credo is to add meaningful support to the ecosystem. \nEither through capital allocation or cheering for entrepreneurs. \nShould we do this more often? In other cities?",

  "text": "It’s Monday morning. Most of us are getting to work while some of our athletes did their work putting Indian on global map. Served a reminder that winning when your odds are against you is a superpower. And i’m not talking about cricket.  \n\nPuja Tomar became the first Indian to win a fight at UFC. And this was her debut match. From a family of farmers in UP she lost her father at young age and took up mixed martial sports at age six for self-defense and empowerment. Won many medals for India and is a six time national Wushu champion. \n\n“I decided to let people say whatever they wanted. It just made me practice harder to show them that girls can do martial arts and they don’t depend on men.” This is Puja saying why she does combat sports. \n\nSanjivani Jadhav won the 10,000m at Portland Track meet in US finishing in 32 mins 22 secs. That’s 3min & 14 sec/ kilometre for 10km. Most of us can’t run 100m at that pace. And she won this competing against world class athletes and Olympians. Last year she dint have any financial support and had to pay for her training in US to prepare for the Asian Champs where she won Bronze. No support from federation or anyone. \n\nSumit Nagal is currently India no. 1 singles player in tennis and yesterday won the Heilbronner Neckarcup ATP challenger. This is a big win and gives him a chance to go to Paris Olympics next month. \n\nEarlier this year he just had bank balance of less than Rs. 80,000 and was struggling to get financial support. He is now back in the circuit winning and competing against the best in the game. \n\nWhy these win matters? Why such athletes matters? \nA sport like MMA is a brutal. Just getting inside the octagon needs superhuman mental and physical strengths. \nTennis and Athletics has to be more than Roger Federer and Usain Bolt of us. It’s easier to create life lessons from these global stars. Much harder to talk about our own athletes because our own media and community doesn’t talk about them. Grit and determination is a common fuel every athlete survives on. Some make it to stardom others continue to fight out every day. \n\nhttps://x.com/kmr_dilip",

  "text": "She said “Winning a gold for India is my ultimate goal”\nYou should know more about this talented para athlete.\n\nThis is Sheetal Devi. The first armless female archer in the world and shoots using her legs and feet.\n\nSheetal was born without hands (Phocomelia) a rare congenital disorder leading to underdeveloped limbs. This means difficulties in performing everyday tasks like eating, dressing, and writing. She had to develop her own techniques using her legs and feet. Growing up, she said “Mujhey bhi kuch karna hai”\n\nIn 2019, Sheetal caught the attention of the Indian Army during the youth games in J&K. The coaches and the family tried to get a prosthetic arm but it didn't fit. Sheetal competed in able-bodied category at the Under-18 level and won multiple medals. \n\nIn 2022, at age 16, she won two gold medals and one silver at the Asian Para Games, becoming the first Indian woman to win two golds at the event. \n\nIn 2023, she won a silver medal at the World Archery Para Championships, becoming the first armless female archer to medal at the event.\n\nShe is an Arjuna award winner and her ultimate goal is to win a Paralympic gold medal for India.\n\nRemember this name Sheetal Devi at Paris Paralympics in few months. \nShe is currently supported by the team at Olympic gold Quest.\n\nI will continue to share about our athletes going for Olympics & Paralympics this year. They are not expecting that. But if we don't do that, their hard work and grit will go unnoticed. Maybe you should also. \n\nhttps://x.com/kmr_dilip",

  "text": "I spend all my time at the intersection of health and startups. Figuring good health and enduring companies. There are few things that are overrated and common in both. \n\n1) Hype- “AI” in startups or “biohack” in health. Buzzwords attract attention but doesn't guarantee outcome. When the hype fades, the reality remains. Stay away from the temptation to get attention, focus on what drives outcome. \n\n2) Spending for quick outcome: Crazy spend to chase growth or splurging on longevity protocols. Money can’t buy meaningful success, only the illusion of it.\n\n3) Obsession with numbers: High valuations in startups or obsessive tracking of health metrics. This obsession will lead to value the measurable over the meaningful. \n\n4) Extreme approaches: Rapid growth at all costs in startups or extreme diets and workout routines in health. Extremes are seldom the answer, they’re usually the problem.\n\n5) Features : Overloading your product with features or your body with supplements. Keep it simple is hard, no one can do it. Making it complicated is easy, everyone can do it.\n\nhttps://x.com/kmr_dilip",

There are two things that stands out in most of my interaction. \n\n\nFirst , If you want to be an entrepreneur , build the muscle to do things that most can't and don't want to do. You will be alone in doing that and you’ve have to accept it. \n\nSecond, becoming an entrepreneur and getting successful as an entrepreneur are two different skills. \n\nBecoming an entrepreneur requires taking risks, being optimistic and putting yourself out there.\nBut getting successful as an entrepreneur requires the opposite of taking risk. It requires humility and fear that what you've made can be taken away from you just as fast or can be criticised by strangers. It requires frugality and an acceptance that at least some of what you've made is attributable to luck.\nhttps://x.com/kmr_dilip",

An unassuming mother of two young Indian chess prodigies Praggnanandhaa and Vaishali. The first-ever brother-sister duo to both earn the Grand master title. Today both of them are well known for their achievements in the sport. Most don’t know that their mother, Nagalakshmi accompanies them to tournaments for encouragement and support. Father Rameshbabu works as a branch manager at TNSC Bank and is honest to say they were facing financial constraints but were determined to support both their kids. \n\nI’ve now spent time with Olympians, World champions & India no.1 on my podcast and a common thread amongst all of them is their early childhood and the parental support all of them had.  The most important economic decisions a society makes are not made in corporate offices, but in homes.\nhttps://x.com/kmr_dilip",

She won gold for India 🇮🇳 in 200m at ParaAthletics World Championship. \n\nSimran finished 200m in 25.95 secs. Go out and try running 200m at that pace. You will feel your lungs in your hand. She was born with semi-developed ears and was kept for seven months in an incubator. Doctors had given up hope and were not sure of her survival. But 22 years later, she became the first Indian woman to qualify for the 100-metre track event in Tokyo Paralympics. Remember the name Simran Sharma for Paris.\n\nHer husband is her coach who is a soldier in Indian Army. The family had to take loan and sell their land to fund for her training.\nThe least we can do is talk about her. Share about her. She is not expecting that. But if we don't do that, her hard work and grit will go unnoticed.\nhttps://x.com/kmr_dilip",

  "text": "That's Mariyappan Thangavelu. Just few hours back he won India's 🇮🇳 first ever Gold Medal in High Jump at World Para Athletics. Media won't share stories of such incredible athletes. But you should know more about him.\n\nAt the age of 5, he met with an accident where a drunk bus driver ran over his right leg that permanently disabled his knee. His school physical education teacher encouraged him to try high jump and he excelled at it. \n\nComes from a humble background, he was was raised by a single mother working as a daily wage labourer and vegetable seller to support the family. \n\nDespite this setback, he completed his schooling and earned a bachelor's degree in business administration. \n\nAt the 2016 Rio Paralympics, he won the gold medal for India. In 2020 Tokyo Paralympics he could have won the gold again but the rains made the conditions difficult and settled for a silver.\n\nHe is a Padma Shri and Arjuna Award winner. And won the Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna award in 2020 which is India's highest sporting honor.\n\nHe used all his prize money to buy a paddy field for his mother and built a better house for his family. \n\nMariyappan believes that his right deformed big toe helps him to get the leap. “This is what gives me leverage when I jump,” he says. “It is my God.”\n\nIndia is a country of amazing sporting talent. But we also need to be a country to celebrate all sports athletes. Everyone doesn't get brand deals and sponsors. The only fuel for these athletes is their grit and determination. Our only job is to cheer them and share their stories. \nhttps://x.com/kmr_dilip",

  "text": "The paradox of a common man. Most of us go through this. Few know what to do and they do it. Others don’t, but that is ok too. \n\n1. The Paradox of Freedom: Do a startup to be your own boss and work whenever you want, which turns out to be all the time. Or, get a corporate job and have your work hours dictated, but at least you can leave work at the office (most of the time).\n\n2. The Paradox of Security: Choose a stable corporate job for financial security, yet constantly worry about layoffs and office politics. Or go for a startup where the thrill of potential success keeps you up at night, along with the fear of financial ruin.\n\n3. The Paradox of Passion: Follow your passion by starting a business, only to realize passion doesn’t pay the bills. Or, take a well-paying corporate job and spend your evenings fantasizing about your dream business.\n\n4. The Paradox of Expertise: In a corporate job, you’ll be the go-to expert in a very narrow field. As an entrepreneur, you’ll know a little about a lot and be an expert in juggling crises.\n\n5. The Paradox of Stability: A corporate job offers a steady paycheck and clear career path, leading to midlife crises and existential dread. A startup offers unpredictable income and career path, leading to daily crises and existential dread.\n\n6. The Paradox of Recognition: In a corporate job, your hard work might get recognized… by your boss taking credit. In a startup, every little success is yours to celebrate… if you have the time and energy to do so.\n\n7. The Paradox of Work-Life Balance: Corporate jobs promise work-life balance with paid vacations you might never take. Startups offer the flexibility to work from anywhere, which really means working everywhere, all the time.\n\n8. The Paradox of Learning: At a corporate job, you’ll attend endless training sessions on things you already know. As an entrepreneur, every mistake is a costly but valuable lesson, with no formal training required.\n\nThe reality of the rat race is that even if we win the race, we are still a rat.\nhttps://x.com/kmr_dilip",

  "text": "I’m often asked how large is the Indian sports and fitness market in India? I don’t have a perfect research on it. But if you want to build something here is how you should look at it.\n\n\nTop 5 sports brands in India had a collective revenue of over 11,500 crores in FY 23.\nDecathlon- 4000 cr\nPuma- 3000Cr\nAdidas- 2600 cr\nSkechers 1800 cr\nASICS- 345 cr\nAll nos. are rounded off. \n\n-Two year ago these brands had a combined sales of 5000cr.\n-All of them grew 35-60% YOY.\n-And these are just 5 brands.There are so many more in the market.\n-Assume 15-20% spends are on non-sports /fitness products.\nA sizeable 15,000Cr+ might have been spent on sports brands alone.\n\nThat’s how much people have spent to stay active. It could be running shoes, athletic apparels, sports or fitness gears.\n\nThese are the same people who are more likely to spend on \n-Playing at sports facilities\n-Eat the right food and will need nutrition coaching\n-Conscious to healthier alternatives to eat and drink\n-And aware of overall wellbeing including mental health and sleep.\n\nSo just go and build something. There is always a market if you build the right product for the right audience and solve for their problem. And help them measure their progress.",

  "text": "This is a scary data. Breast Cancer screening in India is 1.9% against 82% in USA, 70% in UK and 23% in China.\n\nMost common cancers in order of occurrence in India are Breast, Cervix and Ovary in women. One woman gets diagnosed with breast cancer every 4 minutes in India, and one woman dies of breast cancer every 13 minutes. \n\nTypically it costs inr 5-15k. It can be an affordability issue but not for Tier1 cities. \n\nThe common feedback I’ve got is\n1) lack of awareness \n2) the fear of positive result hence avoid\n3) concern of false positive diagnosis and undergoing unnecessary biopsy. \n\nWhat can be done to make screening more accessible and increase awareness? \nOr accessibility is not the issue here?",

  "text": "Most people are afraid of sharing their own thoughts online. One of the biggest mistake people think is that they have to be an \"expert\" to share about something. I'll explain. \n\nThe truth is, people don't want to learn from experts. They prefer to learn from those just a few steps ahead of them on the same path. And once you realise this, it's a huge creative unlock. You might connect with like-minded individuals, but that's just a bonus.\n\nIf you are a founder or a builder of any kind, share your experiences and learnings from the projects you did. Share how you cracked a new growth channel, how you managed retaining talent, how you got the first few enterprise customers, how you built the first version of the product, how you got investors to back you, how you manage your board meetings. Just open source your playbook. \n\nIf you share what you do, how you think, how you solve problems, and who you can help, the Internet will introduce you to lots of people who value you!\n\nYou don’t need hash tags, cute bullet icons or post your own picture with a coffee mug looking outside the window. Don’t fall for people who promise you followers and personal branding tips and sell you courses. \n\nYou are not writing for others, you are writing for your own mental clarity.\nDon't overthink, write , share and good things will happen.",

  "text": "In this podcast, I’m talking to Seema Patil. A mother, cancer warrior and a Director at Zerodha. This is a special podcast. \n\nWe were planning to do this for a long while but never got enough confidence to do it. Finally we sat down and spoke about a lot of things that are mostly not discussed or shared. About wealth, privilege , fighting cancer, life before & after Zerodha , parenting , vulnerabilities of adult life and much more. \n\nSeema is one of the lesser known anchors of the Zerodha story. But there is a lot more to her. I hope this conversation serves as a reminder to never take health granted. And always keep exploring your other side. \n\nLinks to he full podcast\nYouTube: https://lnkd.in/gymQxwEy\n\nSpotify :https://lnkd.in/gfGWfHg5\n\nApple : https://lnkd.in/gs8H65vu",

  "text": "Some trends that can create interesting opportunities to build a health business in India. More details below.\n\n\nFirst- Gaming industry \n-India is the largest gaming market in the world today. \n-We’ve an estimate 568 million gamers. 40% are women. \n-Mobile contributes to 90 per cent of the gaming market\n\nSo what’s the health opportunity?\n-3.5% of Indian adolescents suffer from Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD). \n-Excessive gaming (> 4hr/day) is one of primary causes to musculoskeletal pain\n-Approx 17% gamers report psychosomatic symptoms like nervousness, irritation, headache, and sleep problems.\n-Excessive gaming leads to isolation, neglect of real-life relationships, and a higher risk of depression and social anxiety.\n\nCreate product and solutions specifically for gamers. \n20% of gamers in India are paying users. So there is a sizeable market that will pay for solutions. Build partnerships with gaming companies. They would want their MAU & DAU to be active & growing.\n\n\nSecond- Education Industry\n-Approx 17 lakh students appear for class 12 exams in India every year.\n-Approx 20 lakh students sit of various combined competitive exams every year\n-Approx 13 lakh students prepare for UPSC prelims every year. \n-Over 2 lakh students go to Kota every year away from their home to prepare for JEE and NEET. \n\nSo what’s the health opportunity?\n-Nearly 50 million Indian children suffer from mental disorders at any given time.\n-National Mental Health survey estimates approximately 23% school & college going children in India have psychiatric disorders. This includes anxiety and stress. \n\nCreate product and solutions specifically for students. \n-Parents are the customer. Students are the users. There is a growing awareness amongst educators and parents on mental health.\n-Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) offers a tele-consuelling support to students in managing stress and anxiety. But that's not enough.\n-Ministry of Education has laid comprehensive guidelines to safeguard the mental and emotional well-being of students. But Schools and colleges doesn't quite know how to implement them.\n-Build partnerships with schools, colleges and edutech companies.\n\nI shared some more opportunities in health here https://lnkd.in/gn6ibaGj\n\nIf you are building something to help Indians stay healthy both physically and mentally. Happy to connect and chat.",

  "text": "An unpopular opinion about founders/VC's building and investing in health category. This may disappoint a few.\n\nFirst, if you are a founder building in the health. You've to walk the talk. \nWhat does that mean? You have to be healthy and fit. \n\n-The biggest moat in the health industry is trust. This can't be built by performance marketing or hiring influencers. \n-Why will a customer trust your product if the founder isn't healthy? You don't need six packs. But you shouldn't look unfit.\n-If your product came out from your own problem statement, great. Tell the world how you got there and share your experience. \n-In health industry you scale by not selling features. But by earning the trust. \n\nSecond, don't pitch or raise money from an investor who doesn't walk the talk. \n\n-To build a scalable business TAM is important. But impact is most important.\n- If the first question they ask is, how large is the business and not why you choose to build the product. That's a sign.\n- If an investor doesn't make an effort to experience your product or service and offer genuine feedback. They are truly not investing in you. But chasing vanity.\n- Have seen many VC events ending with alcohol and the food corner filled with junk. And that happens because they don't walk the talk and perhaps staying healthy is not their top priority in personal life. \n\nThat's it. Hope this changes. And we build businesses and products that brings impact on people. And trust is your anchor to scale.",

Every day, every week, every month.\n\nAnd every week, I got two inch closer.\n\n𝗠𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹 #𝟮\nI’ll wake up and stare at the wall looking at all the past training and before going to bed manifest whatever left for the next day.\n\n𝗠𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹 #𝟯\nMarathon training is just learning to be bored while you're hurting.

Not that anyone should follow this. But just incase.\n\nI put all my training on Strava https://lnkd.in/eumPX5w",

  "text": "To all founders raising money from investors. Don’t do this. \n\n\n1) Don’t use dollar for your funding ask and use INR for valuation. Have a uniformity in your numbers. \n\n2) Don’t send password protected decks and expect the investor to generate a password from another link. Don’t add more friction to the review process. \n\n3) Your follower count on Instagram is not equal to business traction. Don’t add that on your growth slide. \n\n4) Don’t add stock images and random quotes as customer testimonials. Genuinity matters. Have seen the same customer face three times in a day on different decks.\n\n5) On your growth slide, elaborate the metrics you are tracking. Don’t assume everyone understands the abbreviations you are using. \n\n6) Don’t assume everyone uses Microsoft teams and add that in the calendar invite. Ask for preference. \n\n7) Don’t put your consultants names as founding members. It’s ok if you are two founders and a few interns.\n\n8) If you are an early stage company (< 2-3cr ARR), avoid vision and mission statements. Put more thought on the problem statement, your solution and why that matters.\n\n9) If you want to show a market trend or data. Don’t just mention “sources”.  Add the actual reference on the slide. \n\n10) Don’t use chat GPT for your email intro. Those are very evident. \n\nIt’s your company. It’s your passion. Be honest in everything you share and say.\nThat is a founder moat.",

  "text": "We celebrate women’s day every year. But have we asked women if it really benefits them? \n\n\nDon’t get me wrong. I am not denouncing Women’s Day. \n\nLook around your meeting room, how many women are there?\nHow many women do you see in your gym or running on the roads?\n\nWorld economic forum ranks India 127th out of 146 countries in terms of gender parity. \n\n48% of Indian women leave the workforce within four months of their return from maternity leave. \n\n25% of women in India face mental health issues which is twice the rate compared to men.\n\n23 million girls in India drop out of school annually due to a lack of proper menstrual hygiene facilities.\n\nThere were no leadership lessons shared on Linkedin when Indian women badminton team won the Asian team championships last month. \n\nWomen’s Day should not be a lip service or a marketing campaign to drive sales and make trendy social media post. There shouldn’t be 364 days of inaction after just one day of celebration. \n\nWhat should we do? \n\nFirst accept that there is inequality, and then support them. Help the women in our life every day and become a responsible adult. Don’t stereotype them to domestic roles. \n\nIf you - whether a man or a woman, spot someone saying something sexist about another woman, speak up. Whether its a WhatsApp group, social circle or at workplace. \n\nLearn to respect consent and boundaries. Every woman might have a different one. \n\nSo to all the brands, companies and men going to celebrate Women's Day. Do it for the other 364 days as well. \n\nWomen’s day is a reminder but our actions every day should be the alarm.",

He was 40+ then. \n\nAll this while building Policybazaar.\n\nAt the age 44 he did his first triathalon and won it. \n\nHolds the record for the fifth-fastest Ironman and third-fastest half Ironman triathlon timings across all Indian age groups.\n\nNext was marathon on his mind \n\nHe started training for Half Marathon and his best is 1hour 30mins. \n\nIn 2022 at Rotterdam marathon he finished 3hr 7mins and qualified for Boston Marathon. \n\nAnd at the age of 50 he ran Boston Marathon finished the race in 3hr 46mins. \n\nHe is 52 now and still trains every week and is competing in triathalons and marathons and running a 5 billion dollar company. \n\nBtw, he qualified for NDA but couldn’t pursue it.

  "text": "We invested in a flour making company. Here's why.\nRoti/Chapati is a staple food for most regions in India after rice. \n\n\nThe avg consumption is 6kg of wheat/month/person. \n15% of India currently buys packaged wheat flour spending approx $2 billion every year. \n\nBut most of the rotis or breads we eat lacks the basic nutrient values. The typical wheat we mill ourselves or buy from supermarkets, is not as nutritious as we assume. Because most of the nutrients in the wheat grains are lost during the grinding process. Since a substantial portion of the population relies on wheat flour for their dietary needs. We wanted to explore if there can be a healthier alternative to existing flour options. \n\nAt Rainmatter we want to create an ecosystem of products and brands that are healthier alternatives for Indians. We are excited to partner with Pranjal Y Kumar and Arjun Rungta co-founders at TWF Flours. They are working on techniques to ensure the maximum amount of nutrition is retained during the milling process. \n\nHere is a detailed post of the announcment and a note from the founders on what they are building and why https://lnkd.in/gi6B7222",

  "text": "Okay, about the recent post by Nithin and all the crazy theories being spread around – there are a few things people should know.\n\nFirst, I work with Nithin closely. We have done workouts and races together. I know him a little more than others making opinions and commentary on social media. \n\nSo, what should be the takeaway from his post?\n \nBeing fit is not equal to being healthy. Most people believe being healthy and being fit are one and the same. It’s not. They are not synonymous and are distinct states of physical well-being. \n\nBeing fit means your ability to perform physical activities such as endurance, stamina, strength, flexibility, power & speed. These are a set of attributes that people have or develop to perform a physical activity. \n\nBeing healthy is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being. Your physiological and internal biological systems should be working in harmony. \n\nWe often look at athletes or movie stars as fit and healthy. But often they are not. If you want to understand the science, read this https://lnkd.in/g_rT5gMM\n\nYou may be a runner, go to gym regularly or get your ten thousand daily steps. Fitness doesn't guarantee health. While being fit can contribute to overall health, it's possible for someone to be physically fit but still experience health issues due to poor nutrition, stress, lack of sleep, or underlying medical conditions. \n\nWe all live a hectic life and are exposed to stress and distractions all the time. It’s even more important for people who prioritize fitness to balance it with healthy living. Stress + rest = growth. \n\nGoing to a gym or doing a run doesn’t get you a heart attack or stroke. \nOverdoing it might. So do everything in the right proportion. \n\n1- Get your blood tests done at regular intervals. \n2- Consult your physician. Not your WhatsApp friends. \n3- Seek help from a qualified nutritionist and trainer. Not Instagram or YouTube influencers.\n4- Spend less time doing commentary on Whatsapp groups and more with your family and friends.  \n \nThe gap between being healthy and looking fit is a modern-day confusion caused by social media. \n\nFitness is important and can be achieved through specific physical activities.\nHealth considers various dimensions of well-being and is achieved by sustainable long-term practices. \nStriking a balance between both is real work.",

  "text": "I think there two massive opportunities in health that is perfect to build now. \nFirst -A McKinsey for personalised health for India.   \nSecond- A Mixpanel for your health data.  More details here ⬇ \n\n1️⃣ So what’s the McKinsey of personalised health? \nThink of it as a high touch subscription membership that includes \n-Blood work\n-Vo2, Dexa scan , Genetic testing , Food allergic testing\n-For females specific tests - Hormonal, epigenetic & more. \n- Personal nutritionist \n- Meals sent to you based on your macros & calories. \n- Personal trainer for exercise programming.  \n- Recovery & sleep intervention based on weekly stressors by an expert. \n- Mental health coach. \n- Personalised recommendations on dietary & macro/micro nutrient supplements. And the products are shipped every month. \n- Regular checkin by a physician who operates on functional medicine & recommends based on health data. \n- Monthly reviews on lifestyle parameters, performance & longevity analysis by a dedicated health coach. \n\n➡️ Thinking this as a Peter Attia equivalent for India. Is the TAM >1 million users? Maybe not. But there is an opportunity to build a $10million company in 5-7 years. Not a super scalable service but a premium and hands on service that can have good margins and grow 10-15%+ YOY. \n\n2️⃣ What’s Mixpanel for health data\nA digital dashboard that gives daily/weekly/monthly insights of your body’s performance.\n-Tracks your Sleep , RHR, Steps, HRV, Skin temperature from your wearables \n-Gives a well rounded score of your health cadence basis your goal.\n-Captures your nutritional info and shows what you missed and what you overdid. \n-Captures your fitness activity and grades your body’s response. \n-Captures your body measurements and tracks weekly changes. \n-Captures your physiological markers and tracks changes. \n- Crates a summary for your physician, trainer or nutritionist. \n- Add an AI assistant that answers your specific questions based on your data. \n\n➡️ This can be a global product. A DIY software tool built by a solid product, engineering, design, data and clinical science team. Can be sold like a subscription tool. I feel there is an opportunity to build a $100million global company. \n\nWho is building this? Or wants to build? Reach out if you are interested.\nHave a ton of wishlist and notes to share and brainstorm.  \nHave been at the crossroad as an enthusiast and supporter for these solutions.",

Kids get excited seeing their favourite sports star on the package. But these are just actors paid to do their job. Explain this to them. Importantly as parent, you should walk the talk and avoid processed food. \n3)Minimize device time. Get them to nature. Simple hikes & treks are a good starting point. \n\nSeek guidance or help from experts. School, play school, nanny will do their job. But your your child’s health is your responsibility.",

It’s a tool that many people don’t use much. Wether you are an athelete, entrepreneur, working professional or just anyone who wants to find the best in you. You need a coach. \n\nYou don't know what it means to be great unless you have a coach besides you. \n\nPrannoy & Gopi has a special relationship that is beyond Badminton. I’m glad we sat down to unpack this and more. \n\nMy takeway- The progress in your goal is the gap between your desire and commitment. The coach is your tool to measure it meaningfully.",

Oldest player in the history of tennis to be World rank 1. \nThis is a special podcast with Rohan Bopanna. \n\n\nI sat down with Rohan just few days before he left for Australian Open. This conversation is not just for sports enthusiasts but for anyone who wants to get peak performance in life.\n\nRohan is redefining sports with his perseverance, consistency and mental strength. In his own words that's his toolkit to success. He is 43 year old and competing and winning at this elite level has never been done in the history of the sport. \n\nFull podcast on\nYoutube: https://lnkd.in/giNUCu59\nSpotify: https://lnkd.in/g9Tmu987\nApple: https://lnkd.in/gbhWiTUT\n\nWe discussed mental models for peak performance in life, how he overcame failures and setbacks, managing stress, his mental & physical training routine, support system we need build a sporting culture in India, parenthood and much more. \n\nIt's a 2 hr long conversation like most of my podcasts 😊.

  "text": "If you are running the Tata Mumbai Marathon this weekend. This is for you.\nRunning a marathon will teach you 42 times more about yourself than an expensive self help course.\n\n\nThis is the story of Sifan Hassan's remarkable win at London Marathon last year. \n\n-Within one hour of the race, she fell off the pace from the lead pack.\n-She was struggling with pain and stopped twice to stretch her hips.\n-For elite runners when they stop in a marathon their chances of winning is almost zero.\n\nAt this time the commentators said \"She needs to stop and somebody needs to give her advice to step off and stop trying to run on. She may not know what to do in a marathon\".\n\n-But Sifan showed grit & resilience to stay on the course limping while her competitors raced ahead of her.\n-At one point, she was nearly hit by the lead motorbike while trying to get to her water bottle.\n-Later she offered water to her rivals.\n-With every kilometre she closed the gap with the leaders and soon was with the pack.\n-And 400meters away from the finish line she surged leaving her competition almost impossible to catch her.\n\nSifan won the race with a finish time of 2hr 18min 34 sec\n\nAfter the finish she said “I learned to be patient and just to run my own race. Just keep going as much as possible and maybe i'll surprise myself.”\n\nRemember:\nBecoming strong is not an event. It's a process.\nDiscipline is remembering what you want.\nStay patient, pace yourself well. \nThe race begins when your mind starts giving up. \n\nGood luck for a strong finish!",

  "text": "Founders, never let the investors be the judge of your passion and commitment.\n\n\nMissing good investments is the occupational hazard of venture capitalists.\nOne of the biggest learning in the past year after talking to 200+ founders is , investors can never estimate the insight a founder has to the problem statement they are solving for. A phone call or a coffee meeting will never be enough. \n\nFounder's superpower is the ability to understand user problems and build solutions that customers may not even ask for. And investors should let curiosity anchor the conversations than making conclusions based on reports or industry thesis. You may still not get it. That's fine. When you're a VC, not all bets are winners – some are just lessons.\n\nBtw, the market cap for Tesla today is $753 billion :) \nThis excerpt is from Bessemer Venture Partner anti portfolio page.",

  "text": "The power of asking ⚡\nThis is how i got my first investor. \n\n\nMost entrepreneurs feel asking for help is a sign of weakness. But my biggest realisation is, it's actually a superpower. \n\nSometimes the driving force is not in who you know, but asking for help from the unknowns. It's a powerful tool to navigate the landscape of social connections and accept the vulnerabilities of having no credentials. \n\nYou can ask for help, feedback or suggestions. The worst outcome is no response. The best outcome can't be predicted.\n\nWhen i was starting ImStrong, my last startup. I knew nothing about raising money. I knew no one in the venture capital or angel networks.\n\nThe only thing i knew was sending cold emails :) Most landed no response but some good folks did reply.  \n\nSo, i sent a cold email to Nithin Kamath. \nI expected it to land no response.\nBut in 10 mins i got a reply. \nIn 2 days, i got an investment offer 😊 \nBelow is the screen shot of the exact email trails that happened. \n \nMe- Hey Nithin, we are building ImStrong. This is the problem we are solving. What do you think?\n\nNithin signed up as a user to try the product.\n \nMe- Asked for feedback.\nNithin replied with his experience of the product. \n \nMe- Hey Nithin, would you like to invest in what we are building? Asked for the money :)\n\nWe got an investment offer within 2 days.\n \nSo, whatever you are building, don't shy away from asking —Asking customers to try the product. Asking potential candidates to join the team. Asking investors for money. Asking random people for suggestions or feedback. \n \nYou may get many \"No\". All you need is that one \"Yes\".",

The biggest impact will happen when we start talking about it at home, office and in social circles. \n\n-Celebrating one women's day in a year doesn't do any good. \n-Men should be comfortable in breaking the silence and engage in conversations with their daughter, sister, spouse & friends. \n-Menstruation education should be everyone's business.

  "text": "Employee wellness needn’t be complicated. \n\nThat’s Nithin, Vishnu & me crossing the finish line at IronMan Goa last month.\nWe participated as a corporate relay team. \n\nWorking in a 9am-6pm work environment can be stressful. Be it corporates or startups. Employers want their teams to be healthy. And employees want to live a healthy life. \nThe mismatch is in expectations.\n\nMost employers over complicate employee wellness by pushing for programs that don't sync with everyone. But sometimes the biggest impact is driven by doing simple things. \n\nAt Zerodha & Rainmatter playing sports is an anchor that has worked well.\nNot just evangelising it but participation from top leadership to everyone in the company. \n\nFor those interested how we do this internally. This is a link to the forum where we discussed everything from event planning, creating a team, training and more. We had three teams and everyone met each other only at the event :) \n\nLink: https://lnkd.in/giV8PgBA\n\nThe upside is, now we have more folks doing events for running, triathlons, obstacle racing and more. There are groups playing some sport every weekend. And all this without any complicated employee wellness program. \nPeople just talk to each other, signup events and show up to the start line. \n\nBecoming a healthy company is not an event.\nIt's a process.",

  "text": "\"Work tax\" is killing Healthcare in India. \nPrimary care consultations last for avg 2mins. But the waiting time to meet the doctor is avg 30mins.\n\nWork tax is the extra time and effort required in a process or system that adds unnecessary complexity. It’s highly inefficient. In the context of healthcare, it's the excessive administrative burdens and manual tasks that healthcare providers have to go through. From obtaining signatures or filling out forms, waiting for diagnostics before they can deliver care to patients. \n\nThis should be reduced or eliminated through automation and streamlining processes.\n\nWhy now?\nApprox 86,000 crore was spent on healthcare in the India in 2022. The potential for cost reduction and improved efficiency is immense. We've to get rid of the outdated and ineffective software systems like billing, eligibility verification, and claims processing.\nThis is a research done highlighting the challenges of Health Information Systems in India. https://lnkd.in/ejHGq52Q\n\nIntelligent automation using AI and sensors can make healthcare become more efficient, effective, improve the standard of care and potentially save funds for the economy. \n\nUse cases i can think of: \n\n1. Efficiency and Accuracy: Leverage the ABDM ( Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission) health stack by Indian Govt. Automate administrative tasks and workflows. Hospitals spends more time on patient care leading to improved outcomes.\n\n2. Data-Driven Decision Making: Sensors can collect data ,identify patterns, trends, potential issues and add insights retaining the doctor's time for decision making than clerical work. There is a lot of innovation happening around continuous monitoring devices. \n\n3. Personalized Medicine: Use of AI to analyze patient data including medical history, genetics, and lifestyle factors. \n\n4.Remote Monitoring: Sensor devices can allow healthcare providers to monitor patients health from a distance & improve medication adherence. The doctor-patient ratio in India is 1:834. \n\n5. Care Coordination: Another use case of ABDM is to streamline electronic health records and information-sharing systems to enable seamless collaboration between hospitals, insurance and patient. \n\nIf you are building tools to eliminate the work tax on healthcare in India, at Rainmatter we are keen to be on your side.",

  "text": "Periods can stop. But you shouldn't. \nFind a way tell this to your partners and colleagues. \nToday is World Menopause Day. \n\nIt's shocking how something that's inevitable for half the world's population is surrounded in so much secrecy and silence. Women spend nearly one-third of their lives with menopause, but there's little awareness about it.\n\nApprox 150 million Indian women are living with menopause and the average age of menopause is 46.2 years. Compared to 51 years in western countries. Premature menopause is a big cause of mental health. \n\nWe need to make conversations around menstruation and menopause mainstream.\n- More open discussions at workplace, family and social circles. \n- Put menopause as part of school, college curriculum.\n- Add it in the workplace culture manual. \n\nHoping more companies, startups and brands will do their part to raise awareness. Build platforms and solutions to raise awareness and create support systems. That's the only way to improve the well-being of our partners & colleagues.\n\nIndian Menopause Society is working to change this by educating women and their families about menopause. \nhttps://lnkd.in/eKqP9Zzq",

Why isn't there a Nick Bare of India?\n\nHere's why someone should attempt it. \n\n-India is the largest YouTube user population at 574 million. The second is US at 246 million users. \n-YouTube has 88% share of online video consumption.\n-Fitness related keywords are the most searched throughout the year. Avg watch time for videos is 15mins. \n-Brands spend 30-40% of their marketing budgets on creators/influencers. Data from the startup pitches we get Rainmatter Health.\n-YouTube creators alone contributed over 10,000 crores to India’s GDP in 2021. \n\nThen why not leverage your own brand and build a business out of it? \n\nGo watch this channel https://lnkd.in/gqXSQFjC\n\nAnd if you're building something like this, would love to be on your side :)",

Never show weakness and be the cheerleader in tough situations is over celebrated. \n\n-Stress + rest = growth. Figuring out the appropriate dose of each is key, and a moving target.\n\n- How you perform on your average days at work or home is more important than how you perform on your great ones.\n\n- Becoming unhealthy is not an event. It's a process. Discipline is remembering what you want.\n\nI hope you get out and start exploring your own other side soon\n\nIf you're new to the podcast, you can find all the past video episodes here https://lnkd.in/gxHbvfJd",

  "text": "Health startups in India 🇮🇳 \n\nThere are many entrepreneurs solving for problems across different spectrum of health, fitness and nutrition.\nNot every story is shared. Not every product gets visibility. \n\nAt Rainmatter Health, we meet many founders and startups.\nWe may invest only in a few but each one has a reason to exist. \n\nWhen i was an entrepreneur, i wished there was an organic way of telling what we were building. But the only option was paid PR and media. \n\nHave decided to share every week names of startups we meet that people should know about. No strings attached. \n\nOne of the biggest mistakes people think is that they have to be an \"expert\" to share about something.\nBut this is wrong.\nThe truth is, people don't want to learn from experts.\nThey prefer to learn from those just a few steps ahead of them on the same path. And once you realize this, it's a huge creative unlock.\n\nIf you share what you do, how you think, how you solve problems, and who you can help, the Internet will introduce you to lots and lots of people who value you!\n\nSo, every Monday,  will publish a new list of startups we met. Here’s the first of many.\n\nMapmygenome - Know Yourself - Personalised healthcare using genomics for preventive health.\nFounders Anu Acharya, Subash Lingareddy,\n\nTuring Health - An API layer of health vitals for insuarance and healthcare providers.\nFounder Pulkit Goyal\n\nNivaan - A new age solution for solving MSK related chronic pain management.\nFounders Nivesh Khandelwal , Vishwas Singh\n\nSnack Amor - An healthier alternative to you 4pm snacking.\nFounder Deepak Grover\n\nInnAccel - At home pregnancy care using smart monitoring.\nFounders Vibhav Joshi, Sumedh Kaulgud\n\nAdsys- Making blood diagnosis rapid and accessible.\nFounder Hardik Sharma\n\nBeyond - An AI powered health co-pilot that answers your personal health questions on Whatsapp.\nFounder Anuruddh Mishra\n\nElevate Now - Solving for weight loss using medical science.\nFounders Rahul Maroli, Suryansh Kumar\n\nNeulife Nutrition - Solving for metabolic health & peak performance with alternative nutrition.\nFounder Samit Gupta\n\nWildermart - AI powered and curated shopping experience for healthy foods.\nFounder Shweta Thakur\n\nIf you've tried these products or solutions, do share the feedback to the founders.",

  "text": "In 3mins, Sifan Hassan who ran the London Marathon will teach the greatest lesson for life & entrepreneurship.\nGoosebumps guaranteed!\n\nThis is the story of her remarkable win.\n\nSifan ran her debut marathon while training through Ramadan and fasting. Was pitted against the best athletes in the world.\n\nDay before the race she said \" I'm scared & feel stupid to show up for a marathon\"\n\n-Within one hour of the race, she fell off the pace from the lead pack. \n-She was struggling with pain and stopped twice to stretch her hips.\n-For elite runners, when they stop in a marathon their chances of winning is almost zero.\n\nAt this time the commentators said \"She needs to stop and somebody needs to give her advice to step off and stop trying to run. She may not know what to do in a marathon\".\n\n-Sifan had the grit & resilience to stay on the course limping while her competitors raced ahead of her.\n-At one point, she was nearly hit by the lead motorbike while trying to get to her water bottle. \n-Later she offered water to her rivals.\n-With every kilometre she closed the gap with the leaders and soon was with the pack.\n-And 400meters away from the finish line she surged leaving her competition almost impossible to catch her.\n\nSifan won the race with a finish time of 2hr 18min 34 sec\n\nAfter the finish she said “I learned to be patient and just to run my own race. Just keep going as much as possible and maybe i'll surprise myself.”\n\nWhat makes Hassan’s story even more special is that she was born in Ethiopia but moved to the Netherlands aged 15 as a refugee where she moved into a shelter for asylum seekers. \n\nBecoming strong is not an event. \nIt's a process.\nDiscipline is remembering what you want.",

  "text": "Nithin Kamath & Rainmatter took bet on me three years back. I'm now taking a bet on others with the same team. Here's a backstory.\n\nJanuary 2020 we raised 3cr from Rainmatter & Raghunandan G for ImStrong. We were building a video streaming platform to make fitness accessible online.\nWe had no clue Covid will be a thing in future. And no, we were not visionaries 😊 \n\nBoth me & my co-founder Selvan Thamarai felt as working professionals we couldn't find time to go to a fitness centre.\nSo can we bring the fitness experience to home? That was our the problem statement\n\n\"Fitness centre is not important. Fitness is\" \nThat was the first line in our deck\n\nSelvan had background in building video solutions so we built a prototype in 6 weeks. A digital tool specific for the fitness experience.\n\nI sent a cold email to Nithin & 20 other investors. Nithin replied \" Hey, i've booked a workout for tomorrow morning\"\n\nWe'd just built a prototype and dint have any supply side figure out yet. I quickly called a trainer friend to come home and take the online session. After the workout, Nithin sent an email to meet him the next day.\n\nMe & Selvan had no clue what to expect\nNithin gave feedback on the product and offered to invest. We raised 3crore at 15Cr post money valuation. This was early 2020\n\nThen 2020-22 became a wild ride.\nEverything was going online.\nWe got a good product adoption. \nBut this meant more competition too.\nThe big guys were spending a lot of money to acquire customers.\n\nWe tried multiple GTM and product pivots. From ImStrong to StreamAnchor. Moved from from acquiring end consumers to selling tools to trainers and creators. Think Shopify for trainers.\n\nLong story short. Post covid the product growth started dipping. With limited money left in the bank we decided to pull the plug in late 2022.\n\nI'm super proud of the product we built and the experiences it delivered.\nGot love from both fitness enthusiasts & trainers. \nVery grateful for the opportunity to build ImStrong.\nGot to work with a stellar team and a co-founder.\nEach one gave everything they had to the journey.\nDeep gratitude to investors for their support.\nWas lucky to have such good folks on our side.\n\nThen early 2023 got back on the road to figure out what to do next. And then Nithin asked to help build RainMatter Health.\n\nThere is a lot happening at Rainmatter Health. So for me it's another opportunity to build something.\n\nWe are investing in companies that are helping Indians stay healthy. I shared why we do this here https://lnkd.in/gBWAZRZQ\n\nBut we want to do much more than that. More on this later.\n\nI'm excited and thrilled to be able to continue doing what i love the most. Engaging with entrepreneurs, work on stuff related to health & fitness. A podcast talking about that https://lnkd.in/gxHbvfJd\n\nAnd do all this with a bunch of super smart folks and a cheerleader Nithin\n\nFew things i learnt along this way.\nShared in the comments below.",

  "text": "India’s real Chak De Girls. \n12 young girls from unknown villages. \nPlaying a sport that is not celebrated. \nAll set to represent India in Rugby at Asian Games.\n\nFantastic piece written by Boria Majumdar. \n\nWhat did playing sports give them?\n\nIdentity. \nIn a village, where women aren’t allowed to play any form of outdoor sport. Or wear shorts. Sports gave them an identity. \n\nConfidence. \nNo one now asks them the marriage question anymore. Even if they do, they have the confidence to say they are playing for India.\n\nRespect.\nAsk them why sports? “Girls don’t have respect. That’s what I wanted to earn for myself and that’s what rugby has given us. That’s why I want to be on the pitch for India:”\n\nFuture\nWhat did Rugby give them? “Everyone wants a better life. You want to eat one extra egg, have an extra glass of milk or one extra piece of fish. For years, we did not have the means to do so. Whenever I wanted to have an extra piece, I would have to think that someone in the family could go hungry. Now things have changed. Now I can provide my family with a better life.”\n\nStories like these are the underrated source of inspiration. \nStories like this should be shared.\n\nMust read article https://lnkd.in/gfvGNbrk",

  "text": "Why is there so much misinformation around health?\nHow can it be fixed?\n\nThis has been on top of my mind for a long time and the reason to have this podcast with Dr Abby Philips.\nHe is a specialist in Hepatology and Liver Transplant. He did his MBBs , MD & DM and is the president's gold medal winner for academic excellence. \nHe has 200+ research papers published to him.\n\nBut there is an interesting other side of him.\nHe is known as TheLiverDoc on Twitter for his work as a crusader against all sort of misinformation on health and pseudoscience. \nHe is a father of three, an avid gamer and a graphic novel enthusiast 😊\nFollow his work on Twitter https://lnkd.in/gHqX2jQD\n\nThere is a lot we discussed:\n-- The reason to be TheLiverDoc on Twitter. You know what i mean :)\n-- How that happened and why it remains important.\n--The universe of quackery & pseudoscience in nutrition, health & fitness.\n--Healthcare landscape in India. How modern ,alternative & integrative medicine works.\n--Business of health and patient care.\n--Debunking myths around supplements & nutraceuticals. \n--Do's & Don'ts for individuals to create their own health protocols.\n--Alcohol, Coffee, Artificial sweetener, Intermittent fasting,Proteins, Carbs, multivitamins and much more.\n--Life of a doctor beyond medical practice.\n\nI've to say this upfront.\nThis conversation is not to prove anything good or bad. But to establish some tools and frameworks that everyone can use to create their own guard rail for health.\n\nIt's 3.5hr+ podcast. I don't expect you to listen or watch it at one go. Maybe you should not. But when you finish, do make an attempt to relay your thoughts to improve the scientific temperament of people around you. That will improve their understanding of health.\n\nThere are a lot to takeways from this conversation and I hope this is useful to you.\n\nLinks to the full podcast\nYoutube : https://lnkd.in/gFmbXCZ9\nSpotify:https://lnkd.in/gwEswCuQ\nApple podcast : https://lnkd.in/gy_dxYXe\n\nIf you are new to the podcast, you can find all the past video episodes here https://lnkd.in/gxHbvfJd",

It looks like work to other people, but it feels like play to you.\n\nWe operate as a sports team. We are building an ecosystem for Indians to manage their health & wealth. And we do this with the founders of our startup portfolio companies. \n\nAdnan founder of Devil Circuit sent this email few days back. To participate in an obstacle race event. \n\nFew hours later Nithin signs up for the race 😊\nRallies everyone in the team to join 👍\nVenu the COO dude of Zerodha starts checking out the competition level 🏆\nSeema stands up to be the cheerleader  🙌\nAnd Karthik seperately signs up as the cheerleader for the Ironman relay team 🙌\n\nThen there is an extended team who is always training for something. Either a trek, race or just exploring their physical & mental best. \n\nAll this because as a team we walk the talk.\nStaying healthy & fit is our moat 😊",

And it shows.\nStaying fit for someone else’s goal is work. And it shows.\n\n-Stress + rest = growth. \nFiguring out the appropriate dose of each is key, and a moving target.\n\n-How you perform on your average days at work or home is more important than how you perform on your great ones.\n\n-Becoming unhealthy is not an event. It's a process. \nDiscipline is remembering what you want.\n\n-Everyone teaches motivation. \nBut no one learns determination.\n\n-Learn when to prioritise yourself and when not to. \nYou will be unstoppable if you have the judgement.\n\n-The progress in your mental & physical health is the gap between your own desire and commitment. \n\n-If you avoid all the risks in life.

  "text": "Winning matters.\nBut how you win matters the most.\n\nThis is one of my favourite moments in long distance running history.\n\nKenyan runner Abel Mutai was just a few feet away from the finish line, and got confused with the signage. He stopped thinking he had completed the race.\n\nA Spanish athlete, Ivan Fernandez, was right behind him, and realised the Kenyan was confused and started shouting asking him to continue running, but Mutai didn't understand Spanish. \n\nFernandez eventually caught up to him and instead of passing him, slowed down to push Mutai from behind to make him cross the finish line. \n\nMutai Won. Fernandez was second. \n\nAfter the race, he was asked- \"Why did you do that?\"\n\nIvan said, “My dream is that someday we can have a kind of community life where we push and help each other to win. I didn't let him win, he was going to win. What would be the merit of my victory if i'd overtaken him. What would my Mom think of that?”\n\nSometimes true victory is not just in personal success but also getting others closer to their wins.\n\nIf there is someone pushing you to win, take time to celebrate them.\nIf there is someone you pushed to win, you are a special person.",

  "text": "How humans seated for hours and barely moving can loose 6000 calories a day. This will blow your mind. \nIt's called the grandmaster diet. \n\n↘ In 1984, world champion Anatoly Karpov lost 10kg at the end of the tournament. \n↘ In 2004, world champion Rustam Kasimdzhanov lost 8kg.\n\nChess players can burn up to 6,000 calories a day.\nThat's three times what an average person consumes in a day.\n\nSo, how does a sedentary sport like chess burn so much calories?\n\nThis is the wild part.\nIt all comes from stress.\n\nThroughout long championships, chess players have to endure immense stress.\n\nYou may not be a grandmaster but there is something for you to takeaway.\n\nLet's understand more.\n\nAs one gets stressed, their heart rate (HR) increases. \nThis rise in HR forces the body to produce more energy. \nand can cause a person’s breathing rate to triple. \nAs the human body receives this extra oxygen, blood pressure increases and metabolism speeds up, which in turn, causes the body to burn calories.\n\nThe primary way chess burns calories is through the use of brain. And for a mentally challenging activity like chess, brain uses more energy. Grandmasters sustain elevated blood pressure for hours in the range found in elite marathoners.\n\nStress and anxiety are the greatest drivers of this weight loss phenomenon. \n\nIs it good? Definitely not 🔴\nThe overwork of brain can cause increased stress, loss of appetite& disturbed sleep.\n\nSo what do chess players do to train themselves to be sharp and competitive? \n\nHere's what the greatest of all time Viswanathan Anand and Magnus Carlsen did. \n\nFix their exercise & nutrition strategy ✅\n\nAnand would do two hours of cardio each night to tire himself out so he doesn't dream about chess. He would go for a run or climb on the morning of almost all of his chess matches to keep a high heart rate. \n\nDuring the 2001 World Championship Anand’s car was caught in a traffic jam with just minutes left for the game. He abandoned his car and sprinted into the playing hall to start a crucial encounter.\n\nCarlsen in 2017 was still winning most tournaments, but his matches were lasting longer & the victories were less assured. \nHe was loosing energy in the last hour of games. \nFixing his nutrition brought the big change. \n\nTill then he used to mostly rely on mix of half orange juice & water for an energy boost. But as he evolved to his late 20s, his body was no longer breaking down the sugar as quickly, leading to glucose crashes. He replaced juices to a mixture of chocolate milk and plain milk, which contained far lower levels of sugar but would also supplement his body with calcium, potassium and protein. \nThis kept his blood sugar at a reasonable level without too big a variation.\n\nIn a recent interview, Anand said \" The most important thing to combat stress is building stamina. In chess, you want to handle handle 6 hours of absolute focus and not make your brain tired. When you get tired you tend to forget things and then blunders happen\"",

Soon.\nGrowth in number of people taking up to running is encouraging.\n10yo kid to 90 yo grandma.\n People are lacing up their shoes to get fit.\n\nSo, how can we get more people to run?\nMore people to show up for local races?\nPerhaps by doing small things right first.\n\nOrganisers job is tough.\nMaking race experience delightful is hard.\nKudos to everyone who are on their feet for weeks leading up to such events.\n\nI ran the TCS10k yesterday. \nAnd few things i noticed that could be fixed for a better experience.\n\n1) Traffic woes kills the excitement. \nThe parking situation yesterday was a chaos.\nFelt there were more vehicles than runners. What can be done?\n-Arrange for a public transport system for the race day.\n-Create a system that allows people to carpool.\n-This can cut the vehicular movement to more than 50%.\n\n2) One event shouldn't damage the environment.\nAlthough the organisers promised green initiatives.\nThe roads were littered with plastic water bottles.\nMore than 1lac water bottles must have been used yesterday.\nWhat can be done?\n-Replace water bottles with refuelling station.\n-Only fast runners prefer not to stop. They are less than 10% of the participants.\n- Cutting plastic waste is is a huge saving both on cost and environmental damage.\n\n3) Marble cake & a carbonated drink given post run 😊 \nDrink & eat for recovery. Not for taste.\nWHO recommends consuming protein within 30mins of an intensive activity. What can be done?\n-Replace the juices/carbonated drinks with a ready to drink protein shake.\n-Instead of a chocolate give a banana.\n- It's worth the extra bucks.\n\nHoping to see more runners on the roads 🙂 \n\nDid you run the TCS10k? #tcsw10k",

  "text": "In 3mins, Sifan Hassan from London Marathon will teach you the greatest lesson for life & entrepreneurship.\nGoosebumps guaranteed!\n\nSifan ran her debut marathon while training through Ramadan and fasting and was pitted against the best athletes in the world.\n\nDay before the race she said \" I'm scared & feel stupid to show up for a marathon\"\n\nThis is the story of her remarkable win this past Sunday.\n\n-Within one hour of the race, she fell off the pace from the lead pack. \n-She was struggling with pain and stopped twice to stretch her hips.\n-For elite runners, when they stop in a marathon their chances of winning is almost zero.\n\nAt this time the commentators said \"She needs to stop and somebody needs to give her advice to step off and stop trying to run on. She may not know what to do in a marathon\".\n\n-But Sifan showed grit & resilience to stay on the course limping while her competitors raced ahead of her.\n-At one point, she was nearly hit by the lead motorbike while trying to get to her water bottle. \n-Later she offered water to her rivals.\n-With every kilometre she closed the gap with the leaders and soon was with the pack.\n-And 400meters away from the finish line she surged leaving her competition almost impossible to catch her.\n\nSifan won the race with a finish time of 2hr 18min 34 sec\n\nAfter the finish she said “I learned to be patient and just to run my own race. Just keep going as much as possible and maybe i'll surprise myself.”\n\nWhat makes Hassan’s story even more special is that she was born in Ethiopia but moved to the Netherlands aged 15 as a refugee where she moved into a shelter for asylum seekers. \n\nBecoming strong is not an event. \nIt's a process.\nDiscipline is remembering what you want. \n\nOn Twitter I’m at  https://lnkd.in/gz7TJyxi \n\nVideo source BBC",

  "text": "School & college failed to teach me health & fitness.\nNeither did my family. \nSo I ignored it till my mid 30's. \n\nThen to fix my own health, I spent the last few years studying and experimenting nutrition & exercise physiology.\n\nI went from an 32yo overweight and unhealthy person to a 40yo competitive endurance athlete. \n\nHere’s what i learned in 3 simple frameworks\n\n1. What you eat is extremely important.\nAnd when you eat and how much is equally important.\n\n-Don't consume food or drink that comes in boxes, bags or cans, the stuff loaded with refined grains, sugar\n-Eat a high protein nutrient dense diet\n-Cook your own food\n^That will be your superpower.\n\n2. You don't need to have a six-pack.\nExercise to feel confident and prevent disease.\n\nYour desk job is destroying your body and ruining your health.\n\n-Lift weights, workout at home or play a sport. Just move your body\n-Consistency is way more valuable than intensity. \n-We lose muscle as we age. \n-If you ignore gaining muscle, you will become weak, more susceptible to injuries and ultimately live with pain all day long.\n-Strength training will recreate the best version of yourself.\n\nThe biggest lie you should ignore is that cardio kills muscle growth.\n\n3. Stress is your biggest enemy. \nAnd sleep is your biggest performance enhancer.\n\n-Stress + rest = growth. \nFiguring out the appropriate dose of each is key.\n-Your hospital visits won't teach you this. \nBecause they make money on your ignorance.\n-Stop eating 3 hours before bed.\n-Stop looking at screens 1 hour before bed.\n-Train yourself to deal with stress with exercise instead of surrendering to junk food or alcohol.\n\nBe curious and read scientific literature. Not clickbait articles.\n\nIt's never too late to take charge of your health.\nGood luck!\n\nI host a podcast called  \"The Other Side” that explores stories like these and beyond. \n\nVideo https://lnkd.in/gxHbvfJd\nAudio https://pod.link/dilip",

  "text": "Is crying good for you?\n\n\nI've a 20mo at home and he cries a lot. Often there is no particular reason. I suppose that's common in most households. Science says crying can be normal amongst toddlers and is a healthy way to express their emotion.\n\nBut I got more interested in this subject. And wanted to find if crying is good for adults? \n\nIn Japan, there are \"crying clubs\" called rui-katsu where people come together to cry and release stress.\n\n- Researchers have established that crying releases oxytocin and endogenous opioids normally known as endorphins. These are good chemicals that helps to ease both physical and emotional pain.\n\n- Crying can also help to activate the parasympathetic nervous system and regulate the temperature of your brain.\n\n- Studies have found that emotional tears contain higher levels of stress hormones and can help to release tension and restore the body to a state of balance.\n\n- Crying can lower blood pressure and pulse rate, remove toxins from the body, reduce manganese levels. \n\nIn some sports you will see players crying after the match instead of fist-pumping and screaming. \n\nMost of the research on this topic has been to understand effects of crying on a person's mood. There are physiological, cognitive, and benefits. \n\nConclusion: Crying can be a self-soothing behavior and has both direct and socially-mediated effects on a person's mood.\n\nResearch references:\n1) https://lnkd.in/gT3hUmd8\n2) https://lnkd.in/gT3hUmd8\n3) https://lnkd.in/g9uRffnV\n4)https://lnkd.in/gPr3f5UM",

Primary triggers are air pollution, smoking , alcohol and poor food choices. \n\nDetailed data published by WHO here https://lnkd.in/gVNc3HBz\n\nIf you are an entrepreneur or innovator thinking about helping Indians make healthy choices to stay fit mentally & physically. It has never been a better time than now.  Happy to be of help in anyway. \n\nYou can also reach out to folks at health@rainmatter.com for support.",

  "text": "Priyanka Gupta asked me why the heck i'm so keen to prioritise fitness. And it took 60 mins to explain the \"Why\". \n\nI hope our conversation is useful in some way. \n\nPlease remember, becoming unhealthy is not an event. It is a process. Like a plane crash, becoming unhealthy is rarely caused by one thing going wrong. Usually, it is a series of ignorance— lack of physical exercise, compromising on sleep, food choices & stress.  All these will interact and then compound. I realised the process late in my life though. \n\nIt's very rare to meet people who are driven by genuine curiosity and passion to learn a new skill. Priyanka is one of them. \n\nLink to the full podcast in the comment section below.",

All the guest i spoke with on my podcast have this common trait of playing some sport. Why?\n\nOfcourse you gain fitness.\n\nBut there are benefits beyond that. What are they?\n\n- Develops a mindset to deal with pressure and competition. \n- Builds mental models for proactive thinking and problem solving. \n- Learning from injuries will prepare you to handle failures. \n- Builds mental toughness. Every game starts with zero. \n- Teamwork. Giving up the ‘Me’ for the ‘We’.\n- Sometimes playing defense can be a superpower. \n- Everyone has a shelf life.

  "text": "The third episode of \"The Other Side\" is here.\n\nMy guest this time is Rishi Vasudev \n\nRishi is the Co-founder & CEO of GOAT Brand Labs.  One of India's largest D2C aggregator. He was the SVP at Flipkart  & Myntra and built their fashion business and has been a CEO of multiple high-growth companies such as Lifestyle International Pvt Ltd  & Calvin Klein.   \n\nSo obviously you would expect us to talk about E-commerce, fashion, startups & scaling brands. Well, we discussed none of this. \n\nWe spoke how playing different sports after 40 shaped his professional and personal life. Learning tennis, squash & journey with long distance running while building a startup.  His physical fitness routine & approach to managing stress. His current training for marathons. And the secret to keep playing different sports as you age. \n\nRishi spoke about his goal for Tata Mumbai half marathon. Quick update: He finished 10 mins faster than his target 🙂 \n\nYou will go out and start playing a sport after exploring the other side of Rishi. \n\nHe also shared the top three areas he would like to invest in health & fitness startups. \n\nLinks to the full podcast\n\nYoutube: https://lnkd.in/gzsqYEff\n\nSpotify: https://lnkd.in/guQGmgSx\n\nApple podcast https://lnkd.in/gMK5fSbv\n\nThank you for tuning into the previous episodes with Nithin Kamath  & Rajiv Mehta .  \nIf you're new to the podcast, the links to previous episodes are here https://lnkd.in/gxHbvfJd",

  "text": "The third episode of \"The Other Side\" is here.\n\nMy guest this time is Rishi Vasudev \n\nRishi is the Co-founder & CEO of GOAT Brand Labs.  One of India's largest D2C aggregator. He was the SVP at Flipkart  & Myntra and built their fashion business and has been a CEO of multiple high-growth companies such as Lifestyle International Pvt Ltd  & Calvin Klein.   \n\nSo obviously you would expect us to talk about E-commerce, fashion, startups & scaling brands. Well, we discussed none of this. \n\nWe spoke how playing different sports after 40 shaped his professional and personal life. Learning tennis, squash & journey with long distance running while building a startup.  His physical fitness routine & approach to managing stress. His current training for marathons. And the secret to keep playing different sports as you age. \n\nRishi spoke about his goal for Tata Mumbai half marathon. Quick update: He finished 10 mins faster than his target 🙂 \n\nYou will go out and start playing a sport after exploring the other side of Rishi. \n\nHe also shared the top three areas he would like to invest in health & fitness startups. \n\nLinks to the full podcast\n\nYoutube: https://lnkd.in/gzsqYEff\n\nSpotify: https://lnkd.in/guQGmgSx\n\nApple podcast https://lnkd.in/gMK5fSbv\n\nThank you for tuning into the previous episodes with Nithin Kamath  & Rajiv Mehta .  \nIf you're new to the podcast, the links to previous episodes are here https://lnkd.in/gxHbvfJd",

Yeah, it was a 2-hour long chat.\n\nWhy is all this important for people on Linkedin? You gotta listen to Nithin on the podcast to find out. \n\nHe also shared the top three areas he would like to invest in health & fitness startups. And his list of the fittest startup founders 😊  \n\nYou've never known this side of Nithin Kamath - guaranteed! \n\nLinks to the full podcast\n\nYoutube: https://lnkd.in/gxHbvfJd\n\nSpotify: https://lnkd.in/gfGWfHg5\nApple podcast : https://apple.co/3FYwGoO",

And now with Whatsapp it’s just easy to forward images, videos, stickers and GIFs. \nBut they all lack the personal warmth and i don’t click or open any. \n\nThis time, I did a hack to deliver personalised greetings. 15 second personalised voice message to 60 people on WhatsApp. Nothing fancy. Simple greeting with individual name and added the family member names if i know them. \nAvg 15 secs x 60 messages = 15 minutes of gratitude. \n\nAnd almost 95% replied back with their personal greetings :) \n\nRelationships also need some manual effort.

  "text": "The power of asking ⚡\n \nMost entrepreneurs start with a great product idea and a conviction to work on that. There’s something equally important — the power of asking. \n \nHere is how that led us to our first investor.\n \nI asked a common friend to make an introduction to Nithin Kamath\n \nThis is the summary 👇\n \nMe- Hey Nithin, we are building ImStrong. This is the problem we are solving. What do you think?\nNithin signed up as a user to try the product.\n \nMe- Asked for feedback.\nNithin replied with his experience of the product. \n \nMe- Hey Nithin, would you like to invest in what we are building? Asked for the money :)\n\nWe got a meeting and then an investment offer within a span of 2 days.\n \nWe couldn’t have got a better investor to begin with.\nNithin is an awesome partner, supporter & a well wisher.\n \nAnd we continue our streak for asking for help and and he is always cheering with his support.\n \nSo, whatever you are building, don't shy away from asking —Asking customers to try the product. Asking potential candidates to join the team. Asking investors for money.\n \nYou may get many \"No\". All you need is that one \"Yes\".",

(usually Siddhasana or even Padmasana)\n\nHow long can you Sit 'Steady, yet At Ease' today? Join us through February as we share a 21 Day Program, training you in Asana, Pranayam, Meditation, Cleansing so that everyday you can add a minute to your Sitting. Starting with 10 mins, we'll get to 30 mins by the 21st of February, which is Maha Shivratri - the most auspicious night to experience Meditation.\n\nYou can follow the Program from your home on https://lnkd.in/fwcmQZv\n\nCome with me on an adventure to Master just 1 Yoga pose - it's all that you'll really need! \n\n#yoga #meditation",

    "text": "10 musts in 2020 for a healthier YOU.\n\n1. Sitting is the new smoking - Don't sit for long. Sitting is really bad for your health, and it can't be reversed by any amount of exercise. I stand and work most of the time. \n\n2. Eat a minimum of 3 different fruits 30 minutes before every meal - I have been following this for the last 4.5 years, and I haven't been to a doctor, and I am so energetic.\n\n3. Drink enough water to hydrate your body. We are 60% water, and water intake has too many advantages. \n\n4. Drink vegetable soup, and have a light dinner (No rice, wheat, non-veg, etc.). \n\n5. 15 min walk a must after dinner. This has helped me much to reduce fat on my tummy.\n\n6. 45 min of exercise with no music, starting with stretching, cardio, and Yoga.\n\n7. 15 minutes of no mind meditation will reduce your stress level by 60-90%.\n\n8. Brush twice a day and massage your gums with coconut oil. Your teeth will be healthy.\n\n9. Do not drink coffee/tea in the morning. Instead, boil Ginger in water and add palm jaggery (a rich source of minerals).\n\n10. Avoid anything white (Refined sugar, salt, oil, wheat, rice, etc.)\n\nHow many of these you don't follow? Share your thoughts. \n\n#successfulpeople #winningattitude #nutrition #healthyeating #healthylifestyle #healthyfood #wellness #cardio  #fitness",
