We may not be well served by models that de-emphasize hiring, or emphasize growth at any cost.

What we need are models that result in sustainable employment generation, sustainable growth.

The reason the IT services industry has worked so well, is because of this. But obviously there are issues with that model - it was perfect for a previous generation. We have to build a better model for today - higher up the value chain, delivering better results per employee.","2025-04-28T09:23:05.709Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7320312217927577600,7322550919844265985)","31ed092b71126d584d3c9e0190016ef7bcd932209052628e89cad31265ac3b87","0","No","No","urn:li:activity:7320312217927577600","7b44ec38194d3864c5ec673271de18abc3e3c739590f3695a85da56f258d6cde"

I was recently discussing with my co-founder (based in the US) how differently things function at a systems level — the way structure, risk, and innovation are approached is fundamentally different from what we see here.

In our conversations with VCs here, we’ve observed that there can be some hesitation around newer, less familiar technologies. This cautious approach, while understandable, can sometimes become a bottleneck for early-stage startups working on disruptive or deep-tech ideas that need early belief to grow.

It would be great to see more founder-first micro VCs who truly resonate with the risk-return-impact mindset.

Really inspiring to see you holding this vision, Dilip. That kind of aligned mindset is what fuels real innovation - not ""destructive"" interference, but ""resonating"" belief.","2025-04-24T07:51:04.144Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7320312217927577600,7321078209263857664)","57d5b6927e9617594b6dc71f658e4e084be5b75dc83b08a901b837958394abf1","0","No","No","urn:li:activity:7320312217927577600","7b44ec38194d3864c5ec673271de18abc3e3c739590f3695a85da56f258d6cde"

"Arshal","Jain","Arshal Jain","https://www.linkedin.com/in/arshaljain","Engineering @ Salesforce","comment","I agree with everything you said, but I think we need to look beyond just the lack of a strong narrative. Saying India's main problem is storytelling or marketing feels like we're missing the real issue — which is focus.

A lot of the well-known “dropout founders” from Harvard or Stanford got into those colleges just to drop out and use the brand name to raise money. Their businesses often aim for quick profits by serving mass markets — not real innovation. In India, we’ve copied the outer layer of that model — the hype, fast growth, and name-dropping — but without the systems or culture to support it.

Many of India’s biggest startups aren't led by founders trying to solve real problems. They're more focused on PR and attention than on building long-term solutions. That’s why we got 10-minute grocery delivery before we fixed Bengaluru’s traffic, Delhi’s air pollution, or the lack of affordable housing in crowded cities.

Maybe we don’t need a YC-style program in India. Maybe what we need is something slower, more thoughtful, and truly built for the challenges we face here.","2025-04-23T12:52:29.129Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7320312217927577600,7320791675319046145)","90d26db77a90cf502bae058c368acdce410877fad35151e5d6022baa15663ed0","1","No","No","urn:li:activity:7320312217927577600","7b44ec38194d3864c5ec673271de18abc3e3c739590f3695a85da56f258d6cde"

In many ways, we’re standing on the shoulders of ecosystems that took the bold risks, so we don’t always need to reinvent the wheel or absorb the same hits.

And while it’s true that we might never have a YC-style moment, it doesn’t mean we can’t create something uniquely Indian.

That said, I still admire those taking inspiration from YC to build founder-first ecosystems here. The intent matters.

If you look at the data from some of YC's batches, more than 50% of the companies originate from outside the U.S.

          Take a look at the stats from the YC Summer 2021 batch:

                    377 companies across 47 countries, representing over 4 billion people worldwide.
                    About 50% of the companies were based outside the U.S.. Top countries, excluding the U.S., included:
                    India (33)
                    UK (18)
                    Mexico (17)
                    Canada (18)
                    Brazil (11)
                    Singapore (12)

         These numbers demonstrate the growing global appeal and the increasing talent coming from non-U.S. countries. With India's thriving startup ecosystem and an abundance of entrepreneurial talent, there’s definitely potential to create a YC-like model right here.

Even the completely indian funds in terms of teams and LPs tend not to fund ideas till it has already generated some amount of traction - this significantly cuts down on the risk capital available for innovation that can disrupt the reality as we see today (say, for example flying taxis - a place where there is active investment in India). Even when such capital is available, it is available at tiny ticket sizes (INR 1- 2cr), which puts pressure on the innovator to continuously return to markets to raise money and move to market with either a product that's not too different from run of the mill products available to as the pressure to derisk more and more with for every new investment mounts.

YC wasn’t built—it was emergent, born from a trust-first, failure-tolerant culture. India’s still in a ‘validation economy’—where degrees precede daring, and compliance precedes conviction. But our edge isn’t mimicry, it’s reinvention. We won’t have a YC because we don’t need one.

In India, the quality of entrepreneurship coaching and mentorship is limited to founders who have had scarcity/survival mindset hence you get an ecosystem limited to those type of founders. Also as the MD of one of India's largest companies once mentioned to me, Indians are fundamentally low integrity (dishonest)--which makes it difficult to have a YC like system in the first place. If you are fighting for survival and fear failure, it is not surprising that you are also dishonest--we will be incentivised to be high integrity if we live in a society that doesn't discrimnate against failure/mistakes. 

At a base level, we lie because we are scared.","2025-04-22T05:35:53.681Z","Yes","urn:li:comment:(activity:7320312217927577600,7320319415781048339)","5bdba9cf5e63f9063e04c461f2a269bd32ac8774b023d34a497c17e549c1217f","0","No","No","urn:li:activity:7320312217927577600","7b44ec38194d3864c5ec673271de18abc3e3c739590f3695a85da56f258d6cde"
