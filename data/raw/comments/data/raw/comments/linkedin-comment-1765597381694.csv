Let’s be honest—it’s super hard to change the mindset of people already set in their ways. But kids? They’re still shaping up, and that’s where the real impact can be.

Think about it: if we train teachers not just in academics but also in building social awareness, they can pass that on to students in really practical ways. Imagine every school kid—whether in a public or private school—doing real social projects. Cleaning a lake, helping in old age homes, running an awareness drive—stuff that actually makes a difference.

And here’s the twist: what if these projects were graded and ranked, just like math or science? That way, kids start valuing social work as much as academics.

End result? A generation that’s not just smart, but also socially responsible and empathetic. Honestly, that’s the kind of future we all need.Dilip Kumar","2025-09-20T15:52:46.106Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7365618821707071488,7375195224849108992)","c31535a3aff9e6da451714ecbd4db2c922caddbaab6ef18121dbec8ef50f7613","0","No","No","urn:li:activity:7365618821707071488","f9c47885cad5b64013bdd3e9fd119b38434a358693bdd4206f52f0a6bb4d93ff"

Big innovations often grab headlines, but it’s the everyday frictions that shape how people actually feel about living here.

For me, one simple thing I’d love solved → urban mobility.
 Not just faster cars, but smoother last-mile transport, safer pedestrian paths, and cleaner public transit.

If tech + policy + citizen effort came together here, it would instantly lift quality of life for millions.

Curious to see what everyday problems others point out — because solving them might just be the most impactful “moonshots” we can aim for 🚀","2025-09-12T09:04:18.435Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7365618821707071488,7372193329301766144)","fd7a81dace16ee53d2723bc5f992e471d0c48532cfb0c15aa578ac9984a26063","0","No","No","urn:li:activity:7365618821707071488","f9c47885cad5b64013bdd3e9fd119b38434a358693bdd4206f52f0a6bb4d93ff"

Solution: Building a platform where we can connect Restaurants, malls, tech park food chains to nearby NGO with proper logistics optimized this can eliminate food waste and solve hunger problem, we have app for almost everything now why not for purpose like this

2. Problem: Huge plastic accumulation and pollution 

Solution: Community level platform to encourage people on segregation of waste, recycling of plastic and most inportantly there can be  community level biodegrade projects where all food waste can be gathered and turned into compost something useful rather than it stinks and combers to waste where no one wants to go near it or touch it, there are many Agri and agri related candidates who are seeking job job opportunities with very low job scope, we can use candidates from Agri domain for their knowledge and Aldo’s serves as a job for them","2025-09-03T03:46:17.551Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7365618821707071488,7368851807483162624)","bc511c3ed5795051c4f9e9e64fcc8d5ccaf02c4d7010f432b1efbe81b9a2fabf","0","No","No","urn:li:activity:7365618821707071488","f9c47885cad5b64013bdd3e9fd119b38434a358693bdd4206f52f0a6bb4d93ff"

I lived in Bangalore for about a year - the traffic was hectic but manageable. Then, just days after buying a new OnePlus 5, it was stolen while I was waiting for a cab. The police hinted at a bribe instead of help. For me, that was it.

We moved back to Kochi permanently and only visit Bangalore for meetings. Life here is far better. Like writers need a creative space, founders too need mental and physical room - Kochi gives us that. Yes, we miss the founder -VC camaraderie of Bangalore, but looking back, it feels like the right call for us and for Bangalore. Why add to its congestion when most of the work can be done from here?

VCs have often told us they were more likely to fund us if we moved to Bangalore. But we’d rather embrace where we are, play to our strengths, and build sustainably than uproot an entire team - their families and vehicles as well - just to add to the saturation. 

Perhaps the solution also lies in fewer people moving to Bangalore unless super critical.

He asked me:
'The speed at which groundwater is running out in so many cities is shocking… Why can’t we just collect rainwater on rooftops and redirect used water back into the ground so it doesn’t run out?'
That simple question captures a massive climate challenge: despite having rainwater harvesting laws and water reuse policies in many states, implementation remains patchy and often ineffective.
Shouldn't we be building tools to make it possible? He wants to create a platform that:
Tracks household water usage in real time
Calculates how much rainwater can be harvested and recharged locally
Provides simple DIY solutions for homes and apartments
Connects communities to adopt water-saving practices collectively
Gamifies conservation so even children feel inspired to participate
Sometimes, it takes the curiosity of a child to remind us that solutions don’t need to be complicated — they just need to be accessible, actionable, and collaborative.

Historical data could then track progress over time. People would know what measures the government is taking, while also being more aware of their surroundings and able to take preventive steps. At the same time, the government would know which outbreaks are occurring, how severe they are, and would have the data needed to act quickly.

Such a system can only work if live data is continuously fed into it. That requires prescription filling and lab testing to be digitised and reported in real time by doctors, hospitals, and pharmacies. Building a robust, fully automated system and enforcing it across healthcare providers is a herculean task.

Without this, people will continue to fall sick frequently from water-borne, vector-borne, and airborne diseases.

How serious is this? Dengue outbreaks have become normalised in this country, as if it's a common thing. It's not. The government reports very few cases, however, the numbers are many times higher. Dengue was hardly prevalent 20 years ago.

Commuting in NCR - metro is there but that needs multiple break journeys. For the people need to travel from Gurgaon to Noida or something equivalent we need some good Buses that can operate E2E.
2. Clean roads for running and biking in Gurgaon- the stretch on Gurgaon Faridabad road is perfect for long run or bike but the whole path is ladden with waste and smell. We are setting very poor standards for our expensive cities.","2025-08-25T12:14:21.894Z","Yes","urn:li:comment:(activity:7365618821707071488,7365718177298747392)","7872996f32a6761bfc5f35a93db42e3528af9c73a1674bdfcccbc48feed962c1","0","No","No","urn:li:activity:7365618821707071488","f9c47885cad5b64013bdd3e9fd119b38434a358693bdd4206f52f0a6bb4d93ff"

We prioritize private transportation (motorbike/car) and are responsible for traffic congestion, air pollution and noise pollution.

We prefer fresh produce (fruits and vegetables) that look good. Therefore, farmers use deadly chemicals to produce spotless vegetables/fruits. We are responsible for soil and water pollution and ecological imbalance.

We always want to succeed and do not see failure as part of learning. We ourselves are responsible for socio-psychological problems.

We prioritize the service industry over agriculture, manufacturing, and research and development. We are responsible for the socio-economic imbalances of the country.

We sell our votes for a few rupees and then criticize politicians and policy makers for the country's stunted development. We are the root cause of corruption.

We are the cause of such endless problems. The best solution to this is for us to change.","2025-08-25T12:07:25.427Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7365618821707071488,7365716430505377792)","f5505211eb0492df4fcbbb00f08e60ce65cb88c2553e7a5cd47307e671456961","0","No","No","urn:li:activity:7365618821707071488","f9c47885cad5b64013bdd3e9fd119b38434a358693bdd4206f52f0a6bb4d93ff"

1. Clean Roads (Road quality and a lot of sand and dust around, If a Lorry goes on the road, there will be cloud of dust behind) 2. Clean Air(With pollution this is deteriorating and Lungs are getting affected) and, 3. Water conservation and clean water (This has become so tough.. RO Installations have increased but still not a safe water and lot of water wastage) 4. Stopping Food Adulteration (No Vegetables we buy is good, they are adulterated) ","2025-08-25T11:48:19.285Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7365618821707071488,7365711623237357570)","1384ce5e23cacb910e3d3e32b883e94f98d373c0544cf70e01be482331cd6fb6","0","No","No","urn:li:activity:7365618821707071488","f9c47885cad5b64013bdd3e9fd119b38434a358693bdd4206f52f0a6bb4d93ff"
