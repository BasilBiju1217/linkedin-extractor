When you are not fit or healthy. It has so much spillover on so many aspects of your life. 

I have literally spent the last 6 months carving a fitter self (mentally and physically) so that I am a capable parent, partner, employee, boss..

Lost 30kgs, started therapy, going regularly to the gym. Learned some lifelong skills w.r.t food, fixed sleep, started meditation. Focused on building extendable rhythms than habits.

I literally feel like a different human being and my kids can most definitely tell that I enjoy spending time with them and not doing it to check off a box.

It is 1 million % worth it.","2024-11-12T06:31:44.997Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7261965818689724416,7261989025857568768)","12ec1d66cb0869920cd6702ba37058cacb49a85eb508b4a1cef65ad394ddb2cd","0","No","No","urn:li:activity:7261965818689724416","cbe31a7493daefa12b7ae4a87abf1d0dcaa3f68aaf5d35eb795256c0c77a35d0"

But guess how underrated is to be a teen. Come home to a parent who has no clue how demanding the teachers are. How long the test was. How tiring the PE class was. How many periods they ahve to attend. All that the parents expect is for the smile, act jolly, cuddle up and act as if they have the perfect day at school everyday!!

You still muster your courage and try not reflect all this and when your dad asks you how was your day, you muster up the courage to say 'fine' and a half smile, keen to get on with the dinner.
