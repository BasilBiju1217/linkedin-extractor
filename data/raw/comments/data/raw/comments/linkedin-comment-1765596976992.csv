"Saher","Mehdi, PhD","Saher Mehdi, PhD","https://www.linkedin.com/in/sahermehdi","Longevity Scientist & Preventive Health Founder 🚀 | Advancing Gender-Aware, Equitable Ageing Solutions | Biology x Behaviour x Belonging","comment","This post deeply resonates with me. As a founder of a preventive health startup back in 2018, I learned firsthand how hard it is to sell prevention in a world wired for quick fixes.

Having lost both my parents to chronic diseases, I’ve seen the devastating impact of neglected health choices up close. The irony? People turn a blind eye to things until they become chronic issues—whether it’s mental health, metabolic dysfunction, or lifestyle-driven conditions. And when they do act, it’s often driven by fear, not foresight.

Prevention isn’t just a business challenge, it’s a behavioral challenge. People take anecdotal evidence over data, ignore long-term risks, and only act when the cost of inaction becomes unbearable. The real shift will happen when prevention isn’t sold as ‘healthcare’ but as status, performance, and convenience—things people already prioritize.

If we want prevention to win, we have to meet people where they are. Make it frictionless, rewarding, and aspirational. Package it in a way that taps into what they already desire—confidence, success, and longevity. Build for behavior, not just health outcomes. Because the real challenge isn’t making prevention work—it’s making people care before it’s too late.","2025-03-12T11:44:25.915Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7297481352231165952,7305554258723028992)","fa4e637012aababa4305c281e2b43a3a6f77822435b706f91496067baabb71f7","0","No","No","urn:li:activity:7297481352231165952","d5b0e5bce2cc57a019e63700e5f2449e166b527a8c4cf0f6512e752a90460f4b"

In my early 20s, I was working on a project called SAFER (Safety Awareness, First Aid, and Emergency Response) to set up safety protocols for institutions, especially smaller organizations.

What I observed was shocking—even schools barely comply with fire safety norms, no drills are conducted, and organizations ignore even the minimum compliance standards. Yet, there’s no mindset to pay for safety, even though it’s critical.

Just like preventive health, disaster preparedness isn’t ‘urgent’—until it’s too late. Projects like these need resource backing and policy push to be sustainable. But even CSRs hesitate to invest in them. Prevention may be a hard sell, but the cost of ignoring it is catastrophic","2025-02-27T10:24:41.024Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7297481352231165952,7300823147186921472)","151443fe0c5fba308d5b84091cda436d06b49fce73a59b281d602c74afb91bd7","0","No","No","urn:li:activity:7297481352231165952","d5b0e5bce2cc57a019e63700e5f2449e166b527a8c4cf0f6512e752a90460f4b"

This really nails the challenges and realities of building a preventive health business. 

It's refreshing to see such a candid perspective—prevention isn't sexy in the marketplace because its benefits are long-term, and people usually opt for what's immediately gratifying. 

The emphasis on repositioning the narrative to focus on status, performance, and convenience rather than just ""prevention"" is spot on. 

It reminds founders that they need to build trust slowly and focus on real, sustainable outcomes rather than chasing vanity metrics. 

This perspective is a wake-up call for anyone trying to disrupt the health space in India—it's a marathon, not a sprint.","2025-02-19T10:23:47.864Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7297481352231165952,7297923821292900352)","d616ed20f1080a39cb993338bc01306ebfb9b3a4b82bac6f2055a6f88ad21f6b","0","No","No","urn:li:activity:7297481352231165952","d5b0e5bce2cc57a019e63700e5f2449e166b527a8c4cf0f6512e752a90460f4b"

Preventive healthcare is hard because nobody wants to put in the work. Brands tend to rely on influencers to sell rather than educating the audience how they can truly understand their body. You would rarely find brands building communities solely for the purpose of educating people. 
Health is not aspirational. It is the dire need of the moment. You can't cheat your audience by promising 6-pack abs and a calisthenic body just in 30 days. Preventive health doesn't need to be glamourised but portrayed as exactly what it is. It needs to be worked upon, and not just for 3 months or 6 months but for a lifetime. 
If you think people don't care about preventive health, look at the LinkedIn feed around filled with people prioritizing mental health over a secure way of paying their bills.","2025-02-19T07:35:28.897Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7297481352231165952,7297881463151108097)","941ccdcc2db6514aa7afd69f0706bd167fed73178289b3f1aab2b446e5a991be","0","No","No","urn:li:activity:7297481352231165952","d5b0e5bce2cc57a019e63700e5f2449e166b527a8c4cf0f6512e752a90460f4b"

Until that happens, there’s always going to be a greater need for curative health solutions.

The reason is that the application of preventive health will always lack consistency without a massive mindset shift.

It’s the intangibles that matter most…discipline, grit, resilience, consistency.

When folks realise that fitness/health has to do with mindset and not visual aesthetics (6-pack and), that’s when true change will happen.

Everyone already knows, or can easily find out, WHAT to do for better health and fitness…yet there is such a massive, growing industry for fitness and curative health.

The holy grail is the bridge that joins the knowing to the doing!","2025-02-18T14:42:35.703Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7297481352231165952,7297626561900351490)","330fa82f97f338a34e8726ba896f7a7e8d979f366ba5d6af4dfadffd751e9b29","0","No","No","urn:li:activity:7297481352231165952","d5b0e5bce2cc57a019e63700e5f2449e166b527a8c4cf0f6512e752a90460f4b"

I am working in the preventive space and I also see: 1) Difficulty in measurable metrics coz if we are preventing conditions like diabetes, BP etc, there is no way to prove it, let alone bring measurable metrics

2) We as a country are in a ""fake it till you break it"" kind of culture, we keep pushing ourselves and wait for literally the breaking point coz no one believes we are suffering until they see us breaking down.

Still high on the belief about prevention, so still at it but everything you are saying is on point!

The challenge isn’t just awareness; it’s changing human behavior, which is infinitely harder than treating a crisis.

But the beauty of this challenge is that it demands a full-stack solution—not just another fitness program, diet plan, or wearable, but an integrated ecosystem that makes prevention effortless, accessible, and rewarding. Enough talk about why prevention is hard; it's time to build a system where prevention just works—seamlessly embedded in daily life, removing friction, and delivering value upfront instead of years later.

The real opportunity isn’t in convincing people to care about health but in designing a model where they don’t have to think about it—where prevention happens automatically.

Out of personal interest, Ive been diving deep into preventive health lately, exploring many theories on a wide-spectrum of opinions.

Then, as I try to ADVOCATE for it with people I care about…. Well, your post perfectly captures the challenge!

Prevention’s real competition isn’t ""curative health,"" it’s Netflix and junk food. The battle is as much about wallets (prioritizing fast vs delayed gratification) than it is for attention.

→ How do we make healthy choices (active) as irresistible as passive scrolling?

From my limited experience, I conclude the problem boils down to a combination of ""self-hypnosis"" and ""apathy.""

- People think they’re invincible (until they’re not.)
- People don't want to think about what scares them (aka Ostrich Policy).

Prevention doesn’t sell because it’s TOO POLITE. Because it's sold to the WRONG INSTINCTS.

It's sad, but people don’t act until they’re scared or shamed. Not because they need ""more education"" and ""awareness campaigns.""

WHAT IF prevention didn't shy away from BRUTAL HONESTY?

→ “You’re not tired, you’re UNFIT""
→ ""You’re not busy, you’re UNDISCIPLINED”

Could truth sell better than hope? It'd polarize more, for sure. But the ""net effect?""","2025-02-18T08:19:54.786Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7297481352231165952,7297530256838578177)","0c587c85edd57a0c5f782ba40acc0526f578dc21a801cea804d0373c7df231e0","1","No","No","urn:li:activity:7297481352231165952","d5b0e5bce2cc57a019e63700e5f2449e166b527a8c4cf0f6512e752a90460f4b"

"Well","O Sip Tisanes Pvt. Ltd.","Well O Sip Tisanes Pvt. Ltd.","","840 followers","comment","Absolutely agree—building a business in preventive health is tough. But there's another challenge we often overlook: the way we define ""healthcare"" itself.

Today, most of what we call healthcare is actually disease care—reactive solutions rather than proactive well-being. Prevention isn't just a ""good-to-do"" habit; it's a way of life. And to make it mainstream, we need to rethink how it's positioned.

✅ Wellness isn’t expensive—it’s misunderstood.
Preventive health can be as affordable as a monthly grocery budget. The real gap isn’t cost; it’s knowledge. This is where professionals, doctors, and health experts play a crucial role—not just in treatment, but in making prevention practical and attractive.

✅ Behavior change isn’t about logic, it’s about desire.
Telling people to avoid unhealthy habits isn’t enough. Just like kids need a candy to build a habit, adults need incentives to embrace prevention. The best health solutions don’t just inform—they inspire and integrate into daily life seamlessly.

If prevention is the future of healthcare, then professionals must sell what people want to deliver what they need. That’s how we shift from a reactive system to a truly preventive one.

People tend to prioritize work, entertainment, and other responsibilities while neglecting their well-being. But when health issues arise, everything else takes a backseat.

In today’s healthcare market, people readily spend on expensive treatment packages filled with machines and passive modalities but hesitate to pay for a physiotherapist’s consultation. This mindset neglects the true value of physiotherapy—expert assessment, movement correction, and guided rehabilitation.
While modalities like ultrasound, IFT, and TENS may provide temporary relief, they do not address the root cause of pain or dysfunction. True healing and long-term recovery come from a physiotherapist’s expertise in hands-on therapy, exercise prescription, and most importantly, preventive healthcare.
Physiotherapy is not just about treating pain; it is about preventing it. Regular assessments, posture correction, and guided exercises can help avoid chronic conditions, improve mobility, and enhance overall well-being. Investing in a physiotherapy consultation isn’t just about recovery—it’s about building a healthier, pain-free future.","2025-02-18T07:17:25.348Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7297481352231165952,7297514530551533568)","81db88feb36ff805698b3ea7b9d403179ea1981e5de6427e64d9c3ea532a31d3","0","No","No","urn:li:activity:7297481352231165952","d5b0e5bce2cc57a019e63700e5f2449e166b527a8c4cf0f6512e752a90460f4b"

Prevention is a holistic approach. Today I got rejected by a bank for a business proposal on same preventative product . The reason is the manager doesn’t use it so no one will use it . Unfortunately his subordinates wanted to by the product . Everything should start from top to bottom . If the employees should have a good fitness, the top management should be working out , even if it’s govt offices same should apply . Hope someday it will happen. Old saying applies Prevention is better than
