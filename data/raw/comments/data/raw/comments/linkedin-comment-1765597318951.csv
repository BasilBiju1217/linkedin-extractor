There’s a growing need for preventive healthcare, and we’re building exactly that at Even. Often, our initial conversations with potential members require a lot of convincing and evidence that preventive healthcare is the way to go. People are accustomed to the traditional health cover model, which only pays for bills; so our features—like free doctor consultations, tests, and specialist visits—can seem too good to be true.

That said, there’s also been a progressive shift in healthcare conversations recently, which is a promising sign that companies building healthcare slowly and steadily are on the right track. 🎈","2024-11-06T07:21:48.097Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7253998285718241281,7259827294578356225)","8f3b3e9e676176a6df20541bda03ad3e85b0ca2e3782204f35c04c5f16a236f7","0","No","No","urn:li:activity:7253998285718241281","a83bbd1d67417a541a516e14f472fda1b068eae2a6ae82841e3a223487206524"

Focus is on preventing disease by optimising nutrition and lifestyle - and the body has treated its own ailments, as it is given the right foundation

We engage - gamefied the product so that users are driven to use the platform and thereby have benefitted

Prove - it has taken us 8 years - the body not a hardware product where testing cycles are just another bug fix

Empower - life happens, we give you the tools that is best for you

Simplify - Science is heavy, we translate it to actionables. 20% of the interventions can bring about 80% improvements. We pick the interventions that give the best results (based on peer reviewed science and out own data)

The current healthcare market in India has long been reactive, centered around treatment rather than prevention, a strategy that has become outdated.

Giants like Apollo and Fortis have traditionally focused on curative care, but the future demands a strategic pivot. Startups like Curefit - house of cult and HealthifyMe App  are ahead of the curve, building their entire model around prevention, user engagement, and holistic wellness, which is proving to be more sustainable in the long run.

The shift to ""prove, not promise"" is key to long-term success. Practo’s user-review strategy exemplifies how validation and trust can become a competitive advantage.

As the healthcare landscape evolves, companies that adopt preventive care, empower users with knowledge, and offer simplified, user-friendly experiences will truly stand out.

Strategically, this isn't just a trend, it's a survival strategy for the future of healthcare.

1. Prevent, don't treat– Tech like wearables and AI make prevention easier and actionable.

2. Engage, don't shout– Personalize care through real conversations, not sales talk.

3. Empower, don't instruct– Simple, clear education builds trust and confidence.

4. Simplify, don't complicate– Keep tech intuitive so patients and providers focus on health, not complexity.

5. Prove, don't promise – Show real-world results. Data and trials speak louder than marketing.

Balance, don’t oversimplify 
Inform, don’t preach 
Adapt, don’t rigidify 
Validate, don’t exaggerate 
Engage, don’t ignore

Will elaborate:

Balance, don’t oversimplify – Find the right mix of prevention and treatment, complexity and simplicity. 
Inform, don’t preach – Provide knowledge and structure, not just one or the other. 
Adapt, don’t rigidify – Be flexible and responsive to the ever-changing landscape of healthcare. 
Validate, don’t exaggerate – Back up your claims with evidence, but don't forget the importance of marketing. 
Engage, don’t ignore – Build meaningful conversations, but also convert that engagement into action.

No stakeholder in the ecosystem is incentivised to prevent. This includes patients. The TG for preventive healthcare is very very small.  

The problem with Wellness/Preventive healthcare is that it sucks out all joy from life ! Wake up at 4 am, workout , eat salads, dont drink, dont smoke, sleep early etc etc. 

Frankly, what's the point of an endless endeavour to prolong a joyless life :-).
