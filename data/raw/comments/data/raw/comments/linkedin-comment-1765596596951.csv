Since the 90s, Indians have powered global tech growth, but at what cost? Recent protests in Australia and England, along with Trump’s remarks, show rising resistance to immigration. Meanwhile, service industries in India exploit cheap labour, luring talent with “onsite” promises that often become long-term migration. Product firms avoid relocating talent abroad, instead building Global Capability Centers here while protecting local jobs. This raises a crucial question: are we truly benefiting, or just undervaluing our expertise? If other nations impose high visa costs and tariffs, why shouldn’t India enforce fair wages and reject the label of cheap labour? By ensuring better compensation locally, even for those without foreign stints, we can strengthen our position. It’s time to rethink how India engages with global corporations.","2025-09-21T11:02:52.581Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7375035321044049920,7375484658983133184)","c37157f914a557932cc86629e8bf0c1467862c6d5b02b45664c7f79c77443165","0","No","No","urn:li:activity:7375035321044049920","5125ecff49b4c19d07509646642ccc1f0c24b1fb9bf287bca8b21ae452f91b2f"

Yes, India could benefit from H-1B visa fee hikes and restrictions in the long term, if:

Domestic industries absorb and leverage the retained talent.

The government and private sector invest in R&D, infrastructure, and innovation ecosystems.

India moves up the value chain in tech, not just serving as an outsourcing hub.

one that allows our engineers to become super engineers. 
Right now the reality is tough. Too often engineers are doing everything except engineering.

Indian engineers are a world-class asset but we lack the ecosystem to nurture, retain, and fully use their expertise. 

And this isn’t just about engineers it’s about every Indian professional.

Hard work is in our DNA. 
For us, work is worship. We give our best but what holds us back is not effort . it’s vision.

But ground reality check: engineers aren’t leaving for lack of patriotism, they’re leaving for basics ; clean air, reliable power, safe streets, less bureaucracy, and dignity of work. India still bleeds talent because we glorify jugaad instead of fixing systems. You can’t guilt-trip ambition with nationalism. Until staying back pays in quality of life, not just sentiment, the 'Indian dream' is just a LinkedIn post.

And let’s be real, if Trump makes the US tighter, Indians won’t suddenly stay back. They’ll just pivot to Canada, Europe, Australia, anywhere the doors are open. Talent flows where systems work.

For us to capitalise we need big bang reforms in urban governance - without it it's a matter of time talent will find another destination. We must remember that the ones leaving India today are not leaving for better wages in most cases - they are escaping the dilapidated infrastructure, pollution, corruption in the hope of a better quality of life.

"Ramasundaram","S","Ramasundaram S","https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramasundaram-s-34907a38","Founder & CEO, Actionpackd | Your AI Transformation Partner","comment","Interesting perspective, but I think this narrative skips some context.

The truth is, the “last generation of Indian engineers” didn’t just build America’s tech backbone - most of them did so as US citizens or permanent residents, not as Indians building for India. The US offered them world-class infrastructure, compensation, networks, and a chance to rise to global leadership and they took it. That opportunity transformed lives, and it’s disingenuous to gloss over it now.

Yes, India today is a much stronger place to build than the India of the 90s. Yes, inefficiencies here are real opportunities for entrepreneurs. But let’s not confuse genuine patriotism with convenient timing. The sudden call to “stay back and build for India” comes right after the US has raised the cost of immigration. It feels less like destiny and more like narrative-shaping.

People will always weigh trade-offs. For some, the US will still make sense, for others, India will. Both choices are valid. The point isn’t to guilt people into staying or leaving, but to build ecosystems in India strong enough that staying truly becomes the better option, not just the cheaper or only one.","2025-09-20T06:19:10.565Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7375035321044049920,7375050875611951104)","36f14431e871affdb304c8c382e500674ada557e8472d141241c053f73996963","0","No","No","urn:li:activity:7375035321044049920","5125ecff49b4c19d07509646642ccc1f0c24b1fb9bf287bca8b21ae452f91b2f"
