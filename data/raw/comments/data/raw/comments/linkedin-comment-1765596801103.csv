"Aseem","Aggarwal","Aseem Aggarwal","https://www.linkedin.com/in/aseemaggarwal","Founder at Skyway | Solving the great Indian health crisis","comment","The insights on resting heart rate are intriguing. I've also found the resting respiratory rate (number of breaths per minute) to be an interesting number. Humans, with a rate of 12-20 breaths/min, enjoy a lifespan of 70-80 years. Dogs, at a swift 30 breaths/min, average 10-15 years. Turtles, with a slow 1-10 breaths/min, boast a century-plus lifespan.

This interplay between physiology and lifespan is super fascinating. If truly our heartbeats and breaths are limited, then athletic performance & meditation go a long way to help increase our lifespan. I believe there is tremendous power in slowing down your resting heart rate and respiratory rate.","2024-02-01T04:39:21.612Z","No","urn:li:comment:(ugcPost:7158667897081364481,7158680200354902017)","7f7c95ad34b6c8a67be3a8f58252cce8b2ea73112d39049a2e88380f70b438f6","0","No","No","urn:li:ugcPost:7158667897081364481","cf9e8be893d4985b6185e1bb3ed4f123af137aa8fa0419464ae61eea68191666"

The beneficial atomic habits add up to incremental benefits over time. The reverse is very much true. Don't let others take the driver's seat of your life. Take charge now. 
Some start a habit and then lose motivation.
The pain of discipline is uncomfortable.
But the pain of regret is unbearable.","2024-02-01T04:11:58.690Z","No","urn:li:comment:(ugcPost:7158667897081364481,7158673309444771840)","3562fc4cc0a7a8668b9920fbad1e27cfe40c008dc74f25da112783c130e5ada0","0","No","No","urn:li:ugcPost:7158667897081364481","cf9e8be893d4985b6185e1bb3ed4f123af137aa8fa0419464ae61eea68191666"

The way we cope with stress, workloads, and pressures determines the habits we develop. People often smoke seeking relief from feelings that, in a way, are slowly harming them. Smoking and alcohol are not solutions. When you, as an individual, suppress your pain, you may become depressed. Coupled with alcohol and cigarettes, it further deteriorates health. It's better to express yourself.","2024-02-01T04:09:24.523Z","No","urn:li:comment:(ugcPost:7158667897081364481,7158672662821515265)","968d022499e7f1bfcc46c7a460080690ca48bb65f0a3df73ec861ef7dca50d2c","0","No","No","urn:li:ugcPost:7158667897081364481","cf9e8be893d4985b6185e1bb3ed4f123af137aa8fa0419464ae61eea68191666"
"Venkatesh","Haran","Venkatesh Haran","https://www.linkedin.com/in/vharan","Senior Patent Counsel","comment","You make some thoughtful points about health being a gradual process rather than a single event. I agree that maintaining good health requires ongoing positive choices, rather than just avoiding one bad decision. Your advice to ""take control now"" is motivating - small, sustainable changes done consistently can make a big difference over time. However, it's also important to have compassion for oneself and others. Progress isn't always linear and there are many complex factors that affect health. Overall though, striving to make wise choices each day, while being patient with ourselves, can help foster wellbeing.","2024-02-01T03:55:55.162Z","No","urn:li:comment:(ugcPost:7158667897081364481,7158669268111310848)","87ef05a43076a3003438569bfffb4a2631e316c2fb8c64b2e58ca0af07a33111","1","No","Yes","urn:li:ugcPost:7158667897081364481","cf9e8be893d4985b6185e1bb3ed4f123af137aa8fa0419464ae61eea68191666"
