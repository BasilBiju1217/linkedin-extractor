Was at a global gathering recently where we discussed what controls the public perception.. And ended up discussing how it's controlled by conversations over social media which is owned and regulated by a certain country so they control what's celebrated and rewarded socially. 

Also, India emerging as a global super-power doesn't sit well with existing & perceived super-powers.. so any conversation on those lines need to be brushed under the carpet so that it doesn't turn into a global conversation and credible evidences of what some people in power don't want to be true..","2025-07-12T01:02:31.257Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7346770726890192897,7349604036146327554)","9ccbf82186451415a6db3c4b7acbf3711e776276b4010e7b408e4823defd58d8","0","No","No","urn:li:activity:7346770726890192897","4556240765c81ea750ca04c22c0490298e37ceb23cdb1bb868f3b4a4d0af1cf5"

"Prasad","Mangipudi","Prasad Mangipudi","https://www.linkedin.com/in/pmangipudi","Sports IPR expert- MD- Sportzprix","comment","Our company launched the Premier Badminton League, which we managed for five years until the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite featuring talented players like PV Sindhu, Saina Nehwal, Kidambi Srikanth, Lakshya Sen, Satwik-Chirag, and others, we struggled to attract big-name supporters. Some celebrities, including Akshay Kumar and SRT who initially backed the league, eventually exited. We also reached out to another legend multiple times, but he only made a brief appearance in Season 5 without promoting the league.

Every season, we invited the Union Sports Minister to attend the inaugural match or finals, but he never attended. Even India's historic Thomas Cup win in 2022 didn't translate to increased support for badminton. Despite brainstorming with legendary coach Pullela Gopichand, we couldn't raise the sport's profile as we'd hoped. Although participation in the game increased significantly during this period, we ultimately couldn't achieve our goals and had to discontinue the league.

It's disheartening that as a nation, we often overlook our true heroes.","2025-07-09T15:26:01.667Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7346770726890192897,7348734181155196930)","67e2653fd45a35a5ba8ca35700ef6ed26b519c70169bc7120a2a52b6750b6b2f","0","No","No","urn:li:activity:7346770726890192897","4556240765c81ea750ca04c22c0490298e37ceb23cdb1bb868f3b4a4d0af1cf5"

Let me share some interesting facts here:
 
The game of Chaturanga, which is considered the precursor to chess, originated in India during the Gupta Empire. Rather than being invented by one person, chess evolved over centuries from Chaturanga into the game we know today, Chaturanga traveled to Persia (modern-day Iran) and was transformed into Shatranj, which introduced significant changes. 

Cricket's obsession eclipses chess due to its historical roots ( The British ), widespread appeal, and consistent international success. Cricket's glamour, entertainment value, and simpler gameplay make it more accessible and enjoyable for a wider audience, while chess, despite a recent surge in popularity and talent development, remains more niche. ","2025-07-04T06:53:58.441Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7346770726890192897,7346793379277545473)","60332ca2b4bdcbdbfd78e648f8ac9db541ce8e4ffe9d0043143930bdd96c76fd","0","No","No","urn:li:activity:7346770726890192897","4556240765c81ea750ca04c22c0490298e37ceb23cdb1bb868f3b4a4d0af1cf5"
