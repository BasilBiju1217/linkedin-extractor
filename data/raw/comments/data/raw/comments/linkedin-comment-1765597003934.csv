However,  a dark side of healthcare startups is growing everyday.

One of the key aspects of healthcare is Patient Privacy and Patient data safety. Startups today are openly flouting the regulations by sourcing patient data (read potential customers) by illegitimate means.

They know about patient history, pan, aadhar details, payments made.

Then they push down complex treatments and surgeries down your throat as Candies.

Such low is the level they are bringing the healthcare down to. (Not that it was great anyway) but most doctors had humanity,  compassion and intent to help patients.

On the contrary, these startups are turning into commercial engines to please their bosses and investors with no regard and empathy to patient conditions.

I hope and wish you succeed as an investor with an empathetic approach towards end users (patients) and guide/educate your portfolio companies about importance of patient data safety, integrity.

Best wishes.","2024-12-04T16:58:25.257Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7269582781670723585,7270119265821704193)","f02dfcf2a0771df158877765a219818cdc479334bb091efdc4499c5907e69358","0","No","No","urn:li:activity:7269582781670723585","c18a4693d08c7c4421818a5b26a09107047486e0f32d71f0c1238d48cf10fea3"

4.	Focus on enhancing metabolism through aerobic exercises, since Hypertension, Diabetes, Obesity and Dyslipidemia are classified as Chronic Manageable Metabolic disorders.

1.	923 employees underwent detailed medical covering all identified important risk factors of MI.
2.	A cumulative cardiac risk score was assigned to each participant as per their reports.
3.	Five categories were created in different colors based on severity scoring.
4.	Based on scores, 191 (21%) employees were identified as high-risk employees, those were in Severely high (5%), Severe (6%) and Moderate (10%) risk groups.
