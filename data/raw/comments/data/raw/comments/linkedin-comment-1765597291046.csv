In my experience, when wellness programs are too complicated or forced, they tend to lose their effectiveness. Instead, promoting a healthy lifestyle through regular conversations and small, simple actions can go a long way in creating a culture of wellness.

This reminded me of pushup challenges I did back when I was working at KPMG and nudged me to do some today 💪🏽 

According to recent stats, https://www.livemint.com/news/trends/only-14-indian-workers-thriving-rest-suffering-or-struggling-gallup-workplace-report-11718204098083.html, a whopping 86% of Indian workforce say they are struggling. 

From my first hand experience of recovering from stress and burnout, I realised wellness travel experiences helped immensely and this led me to building Zencations club. I hope to be a part of the rainmatter ecosystem so we can serve more professionals in their wellness practice.

I love this approach! 

Making health and fitness a natural part of the workplace culture rather than a one-off event or incentive-driven activity can have a huge impact. 

Encouraging employees to be active and engage in fun, informal challenges like push-up contests fosters a sense of community and makes wellness a regular part of the workday. 

It’s about creating an environment where well-being is a shared value, not just a box to check.","2024-08-02T05:47:44.201Z","No","urn:li:comment:(ugcPost:7225004732379979777,7225014387265220609)","18e642369308703ab5420e04967a6a36164259a737359ad80dad1f59db9c8ff7","0","No","No","urn:li:ugcPost:7225004732379979777","b5970bcacc95a0645228b83d906c5a11b9f38e77b46e851c93e0ed0fd42fc9e2"

Ask everyone to close their eyes and think of the happiest memory of their life and then ask how it is impacting their today’s life and thoughts…..


Now repeat the same by asking them to do the same with their worst or most painful memory and how that’s is impacting their life…. If you see tears or anxiety or sweating then that’s a sign of their mental health.
