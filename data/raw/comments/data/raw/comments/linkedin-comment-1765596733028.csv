The real moat for India in Deeptech will come from bridging three gaps simultaneously, patient capital, cross-disciplinary talent, and market validation at scale.

1️⃣ Capital Gap: Deeptech isn’t a 12-month ROI play, we need investors with a 7-10 year horizon, similar to biotech or space ventures. (Rainmatter by Zerodha may solve this)

2️⃣ Talent Gap: Encourage academia–industry labs to work like startups, where researchers are incentivised to commercialise their IP.

3️⃣ Adoption Gap: Partner with large Indian enterprises to become first-market customers for Deeptech solutions, reducing the “valley of death” between prototype and profitability.

If we align these three, India will create its own next wave.","2025-08-11T05:35:07.106Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7360538503241195521,7360544273513009153)","1656ccf359eb41efd55ced9a63a3320df17ad26a937b54d14252c942ba84ac19","0","No","No","urn:li:activity:7360538503241195521","dd4d476aa7d4eef4279ded4c0ef0c90953bdf4f42fc655d82a66c2c234e21867"

Post-quantum cryptography (critical for fintech like Zerodha) 
AI-powered defense systems with dual civilian applications
Indigenous semiconductor and quantum hardware capabilities
