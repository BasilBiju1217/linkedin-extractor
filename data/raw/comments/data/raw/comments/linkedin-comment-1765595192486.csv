Many of my friends and me drink rarely. And for me it is always followed by regret the next day when I wake up with a painful hangover. 

Alcohol is expensive, the after-effects are awful no matter the quantity, and many of us have seen how badly it screws up people's health. We observe older folks who are now experiencing the effects of long-term drinking.

Mind you, I love catching up over a beer but many times I simply say no because it's a working day the next day. 

PS: although alcohol consumption might be decreasing, I feel cigarette smoking is going up (anecdotal evidence). Not many people I know from my grandparents/parents' generation smoke, but I have observed almost everyone from my circle (Gen Z) smoke at least socially.","2025-01-13T09:25:37.892Z","Yes","urn:li:comment:(activity:7284487034633601093,7284500832258084864)","ccab89df78ccb85c19e07e05d3ca110f8113eb37d6c124f770def81226c5320e","0","No","No","urn:li:activity:7284487034633601093","6a378ebea35dc57f04f469c8d58740a63b916c05036b61eb1b6890401cf0d6b4"

That said, I wanted to share a thought on the data. It seems this information was collected pre-COVID, with the last batch being from 2019, which means it’s over four years old. Additionally, since the research was conducted by the MOHFW's Family Health Survey Team, I wonder if it focused predominantly on rural populations. Even if urban areas were included, it’s possible the survey might not have accounted for the elite and affluent segments who often consume alcohol on regular occasions.
While the data provides an interesting perspective, I feel recency and relevancy are critical to forming accurate conclusions, especially in current times. This is by no means a critique of your post—I truly admire the insights you bring to the table. Just sharing my thoughts.
