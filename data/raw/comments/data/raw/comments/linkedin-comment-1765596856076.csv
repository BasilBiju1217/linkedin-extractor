Every year we see olympians lauded, their “poverty” glorified, their caretakers talked about and yet we don’t focus the lens on the poverty enough to change system thinking on the support sports heroes families need. Hell we don’t definitely talk about how acutely it affects the families when these heroes are begging and dying on the streets.
