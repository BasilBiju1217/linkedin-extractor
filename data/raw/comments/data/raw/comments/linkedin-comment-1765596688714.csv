"Himanshu","Tiwari","Himanshu Tiwari","https://www.linkedin.com/in/himanshu-tiwari-biz-data-tech","SDM @ Material | Business Analytics * Decision Intelligence | Data Tech Delivery Solution * Change Management","comment","The issue of adulterated milk is concerning, but a more significant concern is the rising prevalence of lactose intolerance. Lactose is a naturally occurring sugar found in milk and other dairy products. When individuals are lactose intolerant, their bodies are unable to digest this sugar due to a deficiency of the enzyme lactase, leading to uncomfortable symptoms.

Given the existing high rates of lactose intolerance in India, estimated to be over 60% according to various studies, it's likely that many will seek dairy alternatives. The growing awareness of lactose intolerance is expected to drive interest in plant-based milk options, providing a potential solution for those looking to manage their dietary needs.

Because there is no dearth of possible contaninants, and the offenders will likely modify their game, a region level random testing using core labs (relatively more expensive instrumentation such as those used in airport screening but validated for milk) may be a more accurate and cost effective solution. Any consumer can choose to test their sample  occasionally for a cost (cheaper than buying and managing a home device). This can change the behavior of the offenders by making contamination harder to keep up with and more tranparent within society. Spread awareness of the importance of random testing and make testing labs available regionally. This can also be expanded to other food products that may fall in this category of risk. This kind of private testing might be an antidote to lack of centralized regulatory efforts by the government to address these issues.","2025-07-02T08:53:24.342Z","Yes","urn:li:comment:(activity:7346040644156432386,7346098659517775872)","bd2aa70ffc00000054a692707e220cc227eb85609fd9a5aaeec0ac00475ab10a","0","No","No","urn:li:activity:7346040644156432386","21030c1547da2a64e38922fa30b536757bd10b9423dc5718495b060e486e52f1"

Other than antibiotics & and aflatoxins which are a farming and production problems, rest of the problems are created lack of controls by procurement companies. Adulteration is not done at farm level, no farmer will adultrate (max water addition), , adulteration happnes further down the supply chain.

Tried the slant test for milk adulteration, it gave no clear results.

The flow speed and white trail were inconclusive. Since adulteration is a matter of percentage, we need a more accurate, preferably fuzzy output that can quantify it, not a digital one.

One must also consider the fact that the modes and adulterants themselves may keep changing. Till early 2000's, it was more of traditional adulteration where people were more worried about simpler problems like ""is there water mixed in this milk?"". Of course synthetic milk existed, but wasn't as looming a menace. The following period till 2012, saw the rise of synthetic adulterants like hydrogen peroxide, formalin, and other nasties. Thereafter, with stringent crackdown by the apex body, adulteration shifted towards micro level localized infusions whereby tests had to be far more sensitive to detect the same when a small batch of adulterated milk was mixed with a larger quantity of milk. While consumer awareness is steadily on a rise, much to our delight, the makers of such kits must look at tackling 2 things continuously:
(1) Stay abreast with any never-seen-before malpractices and create tests for them
(2) Keep the users (read, consumers) continuously updated and aware of such changes","2025-07-02T05:51:21.126Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7346040644156432386,7346052844225011713)","db5d3e0bb6cd8b136d0a631f4abe7ad7956cbb00836fe1432b9d8700f0c0bb23","0","No","No","urn:li:activity:7346040644156432386","21030c1547da2a64e38922fa30b536757bd10b9423dc5718495b060e486e52f1"
