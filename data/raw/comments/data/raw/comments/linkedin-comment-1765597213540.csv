The cost of Medical education is extremely high and most people cannot afford to invest that much into it, 
The Government Medical colleges in India are very limited compared to the demand of doctors in the society !

And the lack of Manpower and the scarcity of Specialized doctors makes it both a boon and bane for doctors !
Boon : Medicine has become a High income profession !
Bane : Over worked doctors with minimal personal time !","2025-07-02T03:07:46.676Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7337710537067114496,7346011679438082048)","a2fbf535c36355ba6e569a9076da6751c2584d6ef86729bbf533e68fc2481e81","0","No","No","urn:li:activity:7337710537067114496","ed3e715f983037d032792a0f97bfc62f37e0a9004cd23bfd6b51201bd1bf79d8"

However, this approach often worsens the situation by overburdening the system and negatively impacting doctors' quality of life, contributing to their shorter lifespans. Constantly requiring doctors to clear multiple competency exams does little to improve care and, in the worst-case scenario, adds strain to an already overstretched healthcare system. To address this, India must reform its medical education by promoting collaborative and shared care delivery across various levels, and by recognizing that extending doctors' life expectancy by even a decade would have a more meaningful impact than simply increasing the number of medical seats, only to force new doctors into an already broken system.","2025-06-10T08:37:01.950Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7337710537067114496,7338122006019698688)","44084a6023a003232ca5d0284d2ce27a7acafb8d79c56f5d1869692ed1402b19","0","No","No","urn:li:activity:7337710537067114496","ed3e715f983037d032792a0f97bfc62f37e0a9004cd23bfd6b51201bd1bf79d8"

Technology is often pitched as a replacement, not an assistant. A tech ecosystem that enhances, not undermines, their work is missing in the system.

And these are the top 3 reasons for high mortality. Doctors have all the information and the money to buy technology or AI. But the issue is much deeper and cultural. For example, 30 minute simple excercise should be integral part of your day. But not many parents teach the importance of exercise, which carries on with them. Also, there are no good facilities for excercise or even walking/running  spaces in the cities, forget about running on the streets, you can be run over by a car or chased by dogs.

India’s doctors aren’t just dying early—they’re being systemically failed. But history shows us that even the most entrenched crises can be reversed with political will and collective action. Here’s how we can turn this around:

Global playbook India must adopt now:
Work-Hour Reform
 US caps at 80 hrs/week, EU at 48 hrs/week. India? 100+ hours with no regulation.
  Fix: Amend the Factories Act to include healthcare.
Mental Health Support
 US/UK offer confidential, anonymous therapy. 
India? Stigma + no access.
  Fix: 1 counsellor per 100 beds via state schemes.
Violence Protection
 Australia has panic buttons, & Canada runs “Code White.”
 India? Silence.
  Fix: Enforce “Code Silver” + fast-track courts.
Admin Relief
 Scandinavia uses AI; Germany mandates scribes.
 India? 30% of doctors' time is lost to paperwork.
 Fix: Subsidise AI scribes under Ayushman Bharat.
Training Reform
 The US & the Netherlands teach emotional resilience. India? Rote learning.
  Fix: Upgrade AETCOM with mandatory wellness modules.
Wellness Incentives
 The US pays stipends, & France adds 20% pay for stress roles.
 India? No incentive.
  Fix: Link pay to burnout zones + wellness metrics.
This isn’t charity; it’s economic survival.","2025-06-09T08:01:35.483Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7337710537067114496,7337750699104944129)","aa9326895802b0f4b986e30481b5dbb4e65553f9f7c48ac14d337d6e7fdc056f","0","No","No","urn:li:activity:7337710537067114496","ed3e715f983037d032792a0f97bfc62f37e0a9004cd23bfd6b51201bd1bf79d8"

1. Stop having impractical expectations from the treatment . Social media false claims and faux advertisements  by private hospitals add fuel to this expectations. 
2. Do not try to treat your doctor as God,  he has no magic power . He is like other professionals who helps you when you are in trouble.
3. Trust your doctor fully ,but if you have slightest of doubt move on. A doctor has a peaceful mind  when he finds that the patient trusts him fully.
4. Do not judge a doctor by the sheer number of Google reviews or presence of patients in the waiting area. You can buy those.
There is a difference between a good doctor and a famous doctor that you will have to judge.
5. Take active part in the decision making by your doctor.
6.All these will help the doctor to go for defensive medicine at your own cost.

For the doctors  - To some of us it appears that there is no tomorrow. We forget that the doctors are responsible for their families and more importantly their own health.
Peer pressure to own an expensive flat or a car or face book publications for exotic holiday pics doesn't yield patients. It is the time given to them  with a  little honesty that matter most.","2025-06-09T07:32:53.160Z","Yes","urn:li:comment:(activity:7337710537067114496,7337743475158720513)","42d495ece12529d171e9e168e8c17bce5c2514d2f4908fe460b10acfa8a3aa1e","4","No","No","urn:li:activity:7337710537067114496","ed3e715f983037d032792a0f97bfc62f37e0a9004cd23bfd6b51201bd1bf79d8"

Unlike other professions say Bankers who work with each other, Doctors particularly running their own clinics barely interact with their own colleagues/classmates/friends leading to further isolation.

We had a family doctor uncle (my parents' friend) from Sir Sundar Lal - Lucknow, undoubtedly a high achieving genius with extreme detail to attention, who saw our entire family for some 35 odd years; who died couple years ago at age 63. Towards last decade of his life, he has become increasingly lonely, isolated, separated from his wife, chain smoker, and drowned himself in work and books - yet lonely amid the crowd of nurses, compounders and patients. 

Signs of this loneliness and isolation and lack of friends/community around doctors can be seen in mid 40s, as soon as they get more senior and move out from Hospital job system to their own clinic system. 

Sometimes, I deduce, friends and community is the highest life extending agent, ahead of nutrition, exercise and everything else.
