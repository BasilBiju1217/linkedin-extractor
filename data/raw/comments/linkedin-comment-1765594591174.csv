We remain overly reliant on Western coaches in most Olympic sports, which hinders the development of indigenous expertise.

At the grassroots level, the situation is even more concerning. The basic facilities necessary for nurturing future athletes are insufficient, and there has been a lack of comprehensive studies to address this. Rather than spreading resources thinly across all sports in every state, a more strategic approach is needed. We should focus on identifying which sports have the most potential in specific states and concentrate our resources there. This would involve targeted investment in states that naturally produce talent in particular sports, rather than wasting funds in regions where there is little interest or potential.","2024-08-09T03:21:33.858Z","No","urn:li:comment:(ugcPost:7225731343790305280,7227514316839665664)","51c1f2fded653b0b9b419a9c7aa3c16f1e29dd35222bffba8142aeb7155919ab","0","No","No","urn:li:ugcPost:7225731343790305280","f378613b82bf33e37c74e0e6831d29192e6a992263378d4f5fe498e77ef488f0"

Personally, I believe, a (large) part of the problem lies in the cultural mindset when it comes to pushing limits.

The primary problem is very much still a question of priorities and choices when it comes to sports vs academics and this requires a major change in parent’ mindsets.

But, while the government and corporates can do a lot to improve infrastructure and standards, I don’t think it’s going to change if we simply depend on institutions to help solve the lack of success.

There is a tendency for people to make general excuses such as genetics, diet, weather, poverty, infrastructure etc etc for why we don’t have more success. 

For each one of the above, there is a country or athlete that will have proven otherwise. 

Having coached kids in a sport, I have seen plenty of “talent” gone to waste either from a change in priorities or from excuses mentioned above.

Happy to have a private chat Dilip Kumar about some of the issues, I believe, keep us from having more success in sports…and not just the Olympics.","2024-08-04T16:30:14.456Z","No","urn:li:comment:(ugcPost:7225731343790305280,7225900854485147648)","f8891b21a0c60efa18c072da4d425e40fb0562a518c47f71cc586c6e5fda6288","0","No","No","urn:li:ugcPost:7225731343790305280","f378613b82bf33e37c74e0e6831d29192e6a992263378d4f5fe498e77ef488f0"

Working with para-athletes like Suhas L.Y., Sumit Antil, Sundar Gurjar, and Shweta Sharma has provided deep insights into their daily struggles. I believe social media can significantly boost awareness for these athletes and promote other sports beyond cricket. There's widespread criticism of the BCCI for not supporting other sports, but we must remember who supported these athletes during their toughest times. The real issue lies with our politicians and bureaucrats; only a few show genuine interest in sports development, while many are driven by ego and photo ops post-medal wins. Despite this, I'm optimistic. There is a visible shift as more parents are now encouraging their children to pursue sports other than cricket.
