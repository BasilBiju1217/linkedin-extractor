      "There is a lot of brain fog Dilip Kumar but it’s not, necessarily, because of the phone or any device.\n\nWHERE you consume is not as important as WHAT you consume!\n\nI agree, read books…very satisfying. Also, listen to inspiring podcasts…watch inspiring videos…scroll informative, self-improvement, personal growth enhancing information. \n\nHaving said that, I do switch my phone off for long periods…just to get some silence, peace, distance, self-reflection. \n\nWHAT you consume is key and it stems from having the right growth MINDSET!",

      "So much of this comes down to one thing: intentional input. The brain can’t stay sharp if it’s constantly absorbing noise.",
      "Totally agree — we all need less noise and more clarity.\nBut I couldn’t help smiling at the irony… we’re reading this wisdom here, on the same feeds that cause the brain fog in the first place. 😄\nMaybe the real trick is not deleting apps but learning the ancient art of “scrolling without surrendering.”\nA rare skill — almost like meditation, but with better typography.\nAnyway, great reminder.\nSaving this… right after I finish escaping the next 17 reels the algorithm throws at me. 😄",
      "So real. Needed this reminder.\n",
      "This is the perfect call to action for escaping the attention economy! 🎯\nIt’s a brutal, necessary assessment of how modern digital noise drains our focus and productivity. Brain fog isn't a deficiency; it's a symptom of consuming too much junk.\nThe solution is exactly this: less consumption, more creation, and ruthless protection of our most valuable asset—attention. The small, conscious decisions to unfollow nonsense and create something you're proud of are the only true antidote. Save yourself indeed! ",
      "We’re all trying. Some days it’s progress, some days it’s survival. But choosing what matters — even in small ways, is how the fog slowly clears.",
      "Read a book. Save yourself belongs on a tshirt.",
      "I am sincerely feeling information overload. last night I couldn't sleep because i kept on watching reels. And I don't even remember any fruitful key take away from them. It's all blank. I could have done a course or listened to an audiobook instead. Now I am going to put a budget on my consumption of content. Time is very precious. Thanks for the reminder :)",
      "Would add journalling or even doodling ,simple anlom vilom+brahmri + basic streching 7 secs for each movement before sleep as well as the best sleep combo to clear out stuck up thoughts ,emotions ,unclosed loops or conversation throughout the day",
      "So true, Dilip Kumar... Agree to this!\nAs a habit, My founder Tashi (Tanushree) Thawani and I de-fog our brains and activate new neurons by setting aside a whole day (once in a 10 day span) to do non-work related stuff. \nI, as another example, have deliberately planned my day today with activities that keep me active and busy and are a mix of the usual plus some new stuff.. \n\nend of the day, the brain works for us if we take care of it :) ",
      "needed this. \n\nbrain fog isn’t a mystery anymore, it’s a lifestyle. cut the noise, protect the signal. simple, uncomfortable, transformative.\n\nDilip Kumar",
      "Absolutely true :) Brain fog is real.\n\nHere's my beating the brain fog ritual:\n1. Keep the phone away and close your eyes for 5-10 minutes irrespective whether on chair or bed. \n2. Then wake up and look far way outside the window for 3 to 4 minutes. Walk in the sun if possible.\n3. Get back to work station and listen to instrumental music that's not too loud. ",

    "text": "Amul has evolved from a dairy to a nutrition brand and is probably the most underrated case study in modern day business. They did a revenue of 90,000cr in FY25. Hard to think of another company in the world that has done something similar. Notes on what i think they got right..\n\n1) They innovate at cooperative speed not startup speed and still wins. Launched 250 product launches in 5 years and that's crazy speed for a cooperative with millions of farmers, 18000+ village societies, and government-linked processes. Most companies will shiver at this speed.\n\n2) They turned cold chain into a moat decades before most startups spoke about supply chain tech. They run India’s largest cold supply chain with refrigeration networks across rural area and temperature controlled logistics in small towns. This single capability lets them enter any nutrition category quickly.\n\n3) The nutrition transition feels like farmer driven. More milk production means surplus fat & SNF (casien, whey , lactose) and therefore opportunity to create value added products. Every new category like whey, chocolates, drinks, cheese, creates more value for farmers. Most nutrition brands optimise for margins but they optimise for farmer income.\n\n4) Amul is probably the only brand that simultaneously sells mass and premium products all under same brand,  same dairy and distribution and with same trust. Their products range for Rs 5 to 500. Most brands split into sub brands while Amul let the trust carry everything.\n\nNo obsession with burn, CAC ,CM1/2 growth and branding. They quietly proved that trust, scale and farmer first thinking can still beat everyone.",

      "So true. Amul didn’t chase CAC or hype—they built distribution, trust, and farmer alignment. That foundation lets them enter any nutrition category almost effortlessly.",
      "Dilip Kumar Appreciate this post wholeheartedly!",
      " Amul quietly built one of India’s strongest nutrition ecosystems by keeping farmers at the center and distribution as the moat.",
      "Brilliant breakdown. Amul is easily one of the most under-discussed business case studies in the world. They built scale before “scale” became a startup buzzword and did it while staying true to a mission that directly improves farmer income. Hard to think of another brand that balances trust, speed, and purpose so effortlessly.",
      "Amul’s journey is a reminder that category leadership doesn’t always need blitzscaling sometimes it comes from compounding trust, farmer-first incentives, and operational depth built over decades.",
      "Amul has mastered and written the blueprint for building everything under one name, so it truly shows up as 'everyone's brand'.",
      "Love this take. Amul is the rare case study where “slow” beats “blitzscale.” They built a cold chain before it was cool, scaled trust instead of CAC, and turned farmer surplus into national nutrition categories.\n\nWhile startups chase burn and buzzwords, Amul just keeps compounding. Quietly. Consistently. And effortlessly rewriting the playbook.",
      "Congratulations",
      "A local chaat wala in my city bought a 4 cr shop after gaining profit from his Thela, and now his recurring annual revenue is 5cr+ with 70% profit margin\n\nand there are thousands of such vendors throughout the country.",
      "Amul is a reminder that great businesses don’t need noise to build impact.\nWhat stands out is how they scaled with clarity, trust and long-term thinking, not CAC or burn.  A cooperative launching 250 products in 5 years, running India’s largest cold chain, and creating a full nutrition ecosystem — all while keeping farmers at the centre — is an extraordinary achievement.\n \nMost companies optimise for margins.  Amul optimises for value creation across the chain — farmer, product, distribution and consumer trust.\nIt’s rare to see a brand that can play both mass and premium without dilution.  Amul makes it look effortless.\nA truly underrated case study in modern business.",
      "This is a fascinating breakdown, and it actually triggers a question I’ve struggled with for months in the cooperative space.\nAmul and many state level cooperatives share the same foundational model on paper, farmer owned, federation structure, district unions, democratic boards. Yet the outcomes are dramatically different. Amul achieves alignment, speed, consistency and system driven execution across all its unions, while others with the same architecture often struggle to maintain even basic uniformity in SOPs, decision making or brand strategy.\nWhat I’ve never fully understood is how Amul manages to keep its governance so clean and its processes so harmonized across such a large network. How do they maintain discipline, prevent internal clashes, keep political noise away from operations, and ensure that “cooperative” doesn’t become an excuse for slow or fragmented decision making?\nWould love to understand what cultural or structural guardrails make that kind of consistency possible, because clearly the model is same but the outcomes are worlds apart.",
      "Brilliant breakdown. Amul’s scale, trust, and farmer-first model show how disciplined innovation can outperform hype. Truly one of India’s smartest transformations",
      "You have captured so well something I have been marveling for since days Dilip Kumar! To add to that, they have launched some only one in the world - high protein kulfi and others! Amul should have done this long back, but great to see this happening now. #amul should also launch their protein supplement and better infant nutrition products to compete with Nestle, etc. Waiting for it!",
      "This breakdown shows how Amul turned a cooperative structure into a strategic advantage, which of these levers do you think contributed most to their ₹90,000 crore scale. Dilip Kumar",
      "Science says Nutrition is preventive medication",
      "Do you know they are the first Brand in India to have around 15 regional social media handles and run them as any brand page! \n\nWhat regional TV did, they have done it almost in major regional markets. \n\nAnd strange, on how an HUL or a Coca Cola or a Cadbury hasn't yet. \n\nVisionaries they are !",
      "Curious - which part of Amul’s playbook do you think modern startups can realistically replicate?\n\nDilip Kumar",
      "Dilip Kumar Amul isn’t just a business case study. It’s a reminder that when your fundamentals are right distribution, trust, consistency you can outlast every trend.",
      "This is truly a commendable success story of Amul. This also shows what a visionary leader can achieve even from a cooperative dairy and run it like a corporate entity. The only area they are lacking badly today is customer care response time. They are dead slow in it. They operate like a pure cooperative on that front.",
      "Completely agree with this. Amul is a phenomenal example of how clarity, trust and infrastructure can beat speed for the sake of speed. It is rare to see a company that can play both mass and premium markets with equal credibility. A true Indian business classic.",
      "One of the first UNICORN and It was set up in 1950’s with good government support as it was a win win situation for government and co-operative movement and mr Kurian took it to another level ..for any business to grow into UNICORN the first 5 years are the most important break or make years",
      "I'm puzzled how you ignored the cruelty in dairy industry. Here is what you selectively ignored: \n>lifelong confinement of cows and buffaloes, \n>molestation of bulls, \n>artificial insemination of cows and buffaloes, \n>murder of male calves within a few days of their birth, \n>exploitation until the cows or buffaloes fall short of milk, \n>artificial insemination one last time to profit from the extra weight of fetus, \n>transported to slaughter in crammed (5x of animals) trucks,  with chillies in eyes - around 20% of cows and buffaloes deliver calves during transportation, the calves die under their own mothers' legs as their horns are tied up to save space\n>finally, slaughtered brutally as they shiver and scream while the fellow cows and buffaloes are slaughtered in front of their own eyes, soaked in blood ",
      "Interesting point. I would say that this supply chain moat is pioneered by Pepsi and Coke at a much higher scale across the world who are essentially supply chain companies known by the sugar water brands they peddle. In that sense Amul is the Indian Pepsi.",
      "It's even more incredible how Akshaykalpa is carving a profitable and fast growing niche out of this even with presence of Amul and Nandini. I only prefer buying their Paneer, for e.g. because Amul and Nandini paneers don't really feel soft or fresh. Shashi Kumar and team are doing brilliant work. ",
      "It is the beauty of co-operative structure based on which the entire dairy industry operates which is called Amul model wherein village level co op societies affiliated to a district level union which in turn is further federated into a milk federation at state level (GCMMF which markets & distributes it's products under AMUL). Farmers are the backbone of this whole eco system.\nAt the end of the day whatever the federation earns is passed on to farmers in the form of bonuses and price differences",
      "I find a similar consistency and scalability practice by Prestige. Their cookware is unparalleled in India and abroad (Europe).",
      "Many years ago, when I visited their HQ plant in Anand, I saw that they had a small shop attached to it. I picked up their single origin chocolate there, more than a year ( I think) before they were available in stores. \n\nThey use this shop to test new product lines in a limited capacity, before rolling out a nationwide launch. It's a masterclass on how you can innovate and de-risk at Amul's scale. I'm not at all surprised that they're churning out new products at that speed and winning most of their bets.",
      "Supply chain tech - spot on, they implemented a collection centre for Milk back in my HCL days, and I used to manage that account.",
      "Amul is not just a dairy that scaled but a supply-driven powerhouse that turned millions of farmers and thousands of village societies into a nutrition engine. Their 250-product burst makes sense when you realise their cold chain isn’t an enabler, it’s a launchpad. They’ve treated logistics as strategic IP for decades, which is why they can enter any nutrition category almost on demand.\n \nWhat I love most is how every new product—whey, cheese, chocolates, drinks—comes from smart use of surplus milk solids. It’s value creation that genuinely raises farmer income, not just margins. Very few “nutrition brands” can claim that.\n \nTheir single-brand mass-to-premium strategy is another anomaly. Most companies fragment; Amul lets trust do the heavy lifting across ₹5 to ₹500 SKUs.\n \nOverall, Amul proves something rare today: if your operating system is solid—cold chain, farmer alignment, and trust—you can outrun everyone without shouting about burn or CAC.",
      "Brilliant insights. Amul’s ability to innovate at scale, despite a cooperative structure is one of the most underrated business feats in India.\nThe cold chain moat, farmer-driven product expansion, and single brand trust architecture are things even the biggest FMCG players haven’t cracked.\nThis post captures exactly why Amul stands in a league of its own.",
      "AMUL - Anand Milk Union Limited from Anand, Gujarat ",
      "While everyone else chased margins and marketing, Amul doubled down on trust, cold-chain muscle, and farmer-first economics and that’s what makes their 90,000+ crore scale feel both inevitable and underrated Dilip Kumar",
      "If there is one thing I didn't like about Amul, the Brand selling \"Delicious\" a fat spread which looks like butter(misleading consumers at hotels and other places it's used).",
      "The complexity of structured systems is usually seen has hurdles in systems demanding speed. \n\nAs a startup, speed of delivery matters but when done at the cost of inefficiencies or misread consumer expectations , the fundamental damage is already done.  I think the finance world (both institutional and venture funds) need more optimism on structural integrity of young companies over India growth story.",
      "All these at the expense of millions of innocent animals that we apparently revere as mothers and degradation of our mother earth. Humans and their hypocrisy and anthropocentrism at epitome! We only look for our unsatiating hunger for our tastebuds and money, I wish intellectuals and forward thinking people didnt promote this, but here we are, seeing the most influential people falling for the marketing gimmicks of this billions of dollars industry and their half cooked ethics and knowledge. How come we never questioned the fact that we are the only mammals drinking the secretions of other mammals that has nothing in common with us anatomically and in turn get the most horrific of lifestyle diseases. I still have a hope that you will pay some heed to it someday!",
      "Dilip Kumar, this is such a strong breakdown of a brand we often take for granted. Amul’s scale looks impressive from the outside, but the real genius is how they built an entire value chain where farmers, supply chain, and consumers all grow together. I’ve always admired how they entered new categories without diluting trust, something even global brands struggle with.\n \nYour point about them innovating at cooperative speed really stood out. It proves that when the foundation is solid, speed doesn’t need to look flashy to be effective.\n \nCurious to know which of these strengths you feel will matter the most for them in the next decade",
      "Any business that empowers entrepreneurs will always prosper and create massive societal impact. \n\nIn today’s age it may be Alibaba for Chinese suppliers or Amazon for global sellers they all fall in the same category. Without Amazon, I wouldn’t have dreamt of taking my own brand, Lowkal, global. \n\nAmul did this decades earlier for Indian farmers. Their model shows what happens when an ecosystem is built to genuinely uplift its producers",
      "Show me one other brand that is displayed proudly in both Taj Lands End & the beach opposite in Mumbai! From mass to class, there is only 1 butter!",
      "250 SKUs* at best :)",
      "Their journey shows the power of a brand built on trust.",
      "You can’t compare Amul to a D2C brand which is new. Dynamics are different, markets are different",
      "Big fan of Amul India and their products. Like every household, our fridge has butter, cheese and maybe the occasional paneer from them. \n\nBut from a business stand point, here's where we are not looking. Amul introduces new products. What has been the adoption of these products? What would be considered a successful metric for each SKU? \nIf a food based start-up introduces any new product, there are eagle eyes on them to check adoption, quality, YoY growth etc etc etc. We don't see that with the variety of products Amul brings to market. Atleast I haven't. \n\nSo while Amul can afford to introduce more products, I'd definitely love to see how those products have been lapped up by consumers. What do you think Dilip Kumar?",
      "A brilliant breakdown of Amul’s playbook—trust, scale, farmer-first thinking, and cold-chain mastery. A rare brand that wins through purpose, not burn.",
      "Amul is a masterclass in trust, scale, and farmer-first strategy. Innovation and supply chain excellence make it truly timeless",
      "Heart warming to read this Dilip Kumar. I come from the AUML/IRMA family and have deep respect for small producers and the businesses that respect them. Do read a longer piece written by a dear friend Vaibhav Bhamoriya https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/dr-verghesekurien-inspiring-millions-hundred-years-vaibhav-bhamoriya/",
      "Amul’s journey always inspires me. Their farmer-first thinking and focus on trust remind me why we’re building Organi the way we are. Scaling across categories while staying rooted in values is tough, and Amul shows what’s possible when you get that foundation right.",
      "Amul is a reminder that scale built on trust is still the strongest business strategy in India. What stands out is how they solved fundamentals—cold chain, farmer economics, and distribution—long before these became startup buzzwords. In a landscape obsessed with speed and CAC, Amul shows what long-term value creation actually looks like.",
      "Amul is a great case study for the world. In a world obsessed with CAC, burn, and blitzscaling, Amul is a reminder that trust-led scale is still unbeatable. And sometimes, the most disruptive companies are the ones that don’t talk about disruption at all.",
      "Amul grows as a ground up cooperative, which took decades to build and a testimony to the socialist experiments which are slow burn but work for India, bring in prosperity all along.\n\nToday we are chasing Bhokaal, Bhandara and IPO models, of course it has brought mayhem to local economies, but as market rationalizes the era of Amuls will come back, it's all 2008 printed dollar which is finding its way around, major devaluation on the way as AI takes foothold, stress on incumbents is already visible.",
      "It’s always the businesses you don’t necessarily hear about in your daily life, but are quietly a part of millions of daily lives that make a great business.",
      "This is such a sharp breakdown Amul is truly a masterclass hiding in plain sight.\n \n",
      "Amul sells coffee can for both 40 and 90. Same size. And both has buyers."

      "Such a necessary reminder and honestly, a reality most people don’t talk about enough. When the integrity of medicines becomes uncertain, the importance of personal health practices becomes even clearer.  In traditional systems, we were always taught that the first line of defence isn’t a tablet , it’s our own internal balance. Movement, clean food, good sleep, emotional regulation… these are not “wellness trends”; they’re biological insurance.  That philosophy is at the heart of RootCause Wellness™ as well. We’re building it to help people reconnect with the signals the body sends long before it reaches the point of needing intervention to strengthen immunity, energy, digestion, and calm from the inside out.  Because the most reliable healthcare is still the one we build daily, quietly, consistently through alignment, not dependency. ",

The US was the promised land for Indian engineers but not anymore. And India isn’t the India of the 90s when engineers moved out for better pay and exposure. \n\nEarlier generations left India because they didn’t have a choice. Today, staying back is the smarter choice. The US is telling the world that they want fewer immigrants, at higher prices & under tighter conditions. \n\nIn the 1960s & 70s, US actively recruited Indian doctors and engineers to fill shortages. In the 90s & 2000s, IT/software outsourcing made H-1B the obvious path for thousands of engineers. In reality, the India of today is not the India many left behind. \n\nThis is not to say India is without its own constraints. We still have infrastructure gaps and bureaucracy is still frustrating.\nBut if you look back at history, Indian engineers have always thrived precisely in moments of constraint. \n\nThe outsourcing opportunity of the 90s was born from wage arbitrage. The SaaS opportunity of the 2010s came from building global software with frugal & distributed teams. Each cycle has taken adversity and Indian entrepreneurs turned it into advantage.\n\nThe next cycle will be no different. The very inefficiencies of India around fragmented supply chains, healthcare gaps, broken education models will be the anchor to build world class companies. To solve for India is to solve for the future of other emerging markets.\n\nThis is the great inversion of our time and for the first time in history, the opportunity cost of leaving India may be greater than the opportunity cost of staying.\n\nThe last generation of Indian engineers built America’s tech backbone.

      "You're right, Dilip Kumar India today is brimming with opportunities for engineers to innovate and solve real problems. The time to build for India, and the world, from home is now. Let's shape the future together!",

Today, staying is strategy.\nYes, India still has many flaws, but those very gaps are where the next generation of builders will thrive.\nI own a consultancy Techfastic & I am working with SMBs & we hire, arrange interviewers, handle salaries, tax compliance, payments so almost everything.The talent is ready in India, the market is ready. All it just needs the courage to stay and build.\nThis is bigger than visas. This is a moment to decide whether we keep exporting our best minds or finally build a future worth staying for.",

      "Globalisation and liberalisation must be redefined for today’s realities. Since the 90s, Indians have powered global tech growth, but at what cost? Recent protests in Australia and England, along with Trump’s remarks, show rising resistance to immigration. Meanwhile, service industries in India exploit cheap labour, luring talent with “onsite” promises that often become long-term migration. Product firms avoid relocating talent abroad, instead building Global Capability Centers here while protecting local jobs. This raises a crucial question: are we truly benefiting, or just undervaluing our expertise? If other nations impose high visa costs and tariffs, why shouldn’t India enforce fair wages and reject the label of cheap labour? By ensuring better compensation locally, even for those without foreign stints, we can strengthen our position. It’s time to rethink how India engages with global corporations.",

      "Dilip Kumar \n\nYes, India could benefit from H-1B visa fee hikes and restrictions in the long term, if:\n\nDomestic industries absorb and leverage the retained talent.\n\nThe government and private sector invest in R&D, infrastructure, and innovation ecosystems.\n\nIndia moves up the value chain in tech, not just serving as an outsourcing hub.\n\nOtherwise, there's a risk that opportunity without access could turn into frustration, not growth.",

Too often engineers are doing everything except engineering.\n\nIndian engineers are a world-class asset but we lack the ecosystem to nurture, retain, and fully use their expertise. \n\nAnd this isn’t just about engineers it’s about every Indian professional.\n\nHard work is in our DNA. \nFor us, work is worship. We give our best but what holds us back is not effort . it’s vision.\n\nThis isn’t a rant it’s the truth.",

      "It was never engineering. But the VC culture.. they need to invest in India's Deeptech and SaaS..\nWe need a YC equivalent in India..",
      "Totally agree. Returned from US to India 6 months ago and I think it was the best decision ever.\n\nIt is time for Indians to pursue the 'Indian dream'.",
      "Love the pep talk, Dilip Kumar. But ground reality check: engineers aren’t leaving for lack of patriotism, they’re leaving for basics ; clean air, reliable power, safe streets, less bureaucracy, and dignity of work. India still bleeds talent because we glorify jugaad instead of fixing systems. You can’t guilt-trip ambition with nationalism. Until staying back pays in quality of life, not just sentiment, the 'Indian dream' is just a LinkedIn post.\n\nAnd let’s be real, if Trump makes the US tighter, Indians won’t suddenly stay back. They’ll just pivot to Canada, Europe, Australia, anywhere the doors are open. Talent flows where systems work.\n\nThat said, love your efforts and the Indian spirit you’re rooting for.",

For us to capitalise we need big bang reforms in urban governance - without it it's a matter of time talent will find another destination.

      "Interesting perspective, but I think this narrative skips some context.\n\nThe truth is, the “last generation of Indian engineers” didn’t just build America’s tech backbone - most of them did so as US citizens or permanent residents, not as Indians building for India. The US offered them world-class infrastructure, compensation, networks, and a chance to rise to global leadership and they took it. That opportunity transformed lives, and it’s disingenuous to gloss over it now.\n\nYes, India today is a much stronger place to build than the India of the 90s. Yes, inefficiencies here are real opportunities for entrepreneurs. But let’s not confuse genuine patriotism with convenient timing. The sudden call to “stay back and build for India” comes right after the US has raised the cost of immigration. It feels less like destiny and more like narrative-shaping.\n\nPeople will always weigh trade-offs. For some, the US will still make sense, for others, India will. Both choices are valid. The point isn’t to guilt people into staying or leaving, but to build ecosystems in India strong enough that staying truly becomes the better option, not just the cheaper or only one.",

      "I feel one of the best places to put our social investment is in the next generation. Let’s be honest—it’s super hard to change the mindset of people already set in their ways. But kids? They’re still shaping up, and that’s where the real impact can be.\n\nThink about it: if we train teachers not just in academics but also in building social awareness, they can pass that on to students in really practical ways. Imagine every school kid—whether in a public or private school—doing real social projects. Cleaning a lake, helping in old age homes, running an awareness drive—stuff that actually makes a difference.\n\nAnd here’s the twist: what if these projects were graded and ranked, just like math or science? That way, kids start valuing social work as much as academics.\n\nEnd result? A generation that’s not just smart, but also socially responsible and empathetic. Honestly, that’s the kind of future we all need.Dilip Kumar",

Yes, we miss the founder -VC camaraderie of Bangalore, but looking back, it feels like the right call for us and for Bangalore. Why add to its congestion when most of the work can be done from here?\n\nVCs have often told us they were more likely to fund us if we moved to Bangalore. But we’d rather embrace where we are, play to our strengths, and build sustainably than uproot an entire team - their families and vehicles as well - just to add to the saturation. \n\nPerhaps the solution also lies in fewer people moving to Bangalore unless super critical.

(Rainmatter by Zerodha may solve this)\n\n2️⃣ Talent Gap: Encourage academia–industry labs to work like startups, where researchers are incentivised to commercialise their IP.\n\n3️⃣ Adoption Gap: Partner with large Indian enterprises to become first-market customers for Deeptech solutions, reducing the “valley of death” between prototype and profitability.\n\nIf we align these three, India will create its own next wave.",

      "At this rate, I’ll need a protein powder just to recover from all the protein marketing 😅",
      "So truuee! Also, please eat enough fiber, and drink enough water for proper assimilation and to avoid long term digestive issues 🥹",
      "I feel the same for Mental Health Dilip Kumar",
      "Next pitch idea: Protein + Coffee = Proffee\nUnlimited TAM, SAM, SOM, STD, ISD, PCO.",
      "Brands are still heavily focused on protein powders and bars, but the real opportunity lies in integrating protein into everyday food - making it a natural, effortless part of daily diets.",
      "When the noise drowns the message, real value gets lost purposeful nutrition always wins over flashy claims Dilip Kumar.",
      "Protein is everywhere, from drinks to snacks but except in our blood reports :) (but again, you become a kidney patient, and your doctor's first advice is \"cut down\" protein) :))) Dilip Kumar",
      "And every protein brand makes you feel lighter and no bloating! ",
      "So well said 😅\n We’re seeing more protein brands than people actually moving their bodies.\nAt Elevate, we keep it simple — nutrition is important, but without mindful movement, breathwork, and proper rest, no powder can do the magic alone.\nIt’s not about trends, it’s about sustainable habits.\n Move with intention, eat with awareness, and let wellness be personal — not performative. 🙌",
      "The startup world in India has a recurring theme chasing categories instead of solving real problems. A couple of years back it was personal care and coffee. Today it's protein and lab grown diamonds.",
      "Couldn’t agree more !",
      "Just like AI, Fintech, Deep-tech, Health-tech... blah blah blah... By the way I am eagerly waiting for protein alcohol now that we already have prebiotic cola!",
      "True! It’s like Shark Tank meets gym bros at this point 😂 Everyone’s selling scoops of science and hope. Love the reminder,nutrition should be personal, not promotional"

    "text": "Every week, I get a 10 new startup pitches that says “We’ll deliver healthcare in 10 minutes.” Quick commerce is now rushing into healthcare. So I thought to do a breakdown on what’s hype and what might actually work in India. \n\nWhat could work?\n1)30–60 min medicine delivery can work for chronic refills or acute needs. In metros with dense demand, it's useful. But 10-min isn’t necessary. Even same-day is fine for 90% of use cases. And honestly, your local chemist is already doing that.\n\n2) Rapid diagnostics for home blood collection isn’t about speed but it’s about hygiene and reliability. A 2-hour sample pickup and next-morning results is a solid win. What we need is better logistics and trained phlebotomists, not faster scooters.\n\n3)On-demand nursing or paramedic visits but for use cases like wound care, IV, injections. Could work with proper scheduling. Think “Ola for nurses,” not “Blinkit for bandages.” Needs backend infra for verification, training, EMR integration.\n\nWhat won’t work (At least not now)\n1) Ambulance in 10 mins sounds great until you hit Delhi or Bangalore traffic. Speed is useless without triage and location accuracy. What we really need is better coordination between hospitals and ambulance providers, not just faster wheels.\n\n2) On-demand doctors in 10 mins is a bad idea. You don’t need any doctor fast but you need the right one. Discovery & matching are bigger problems than speed. Most video consults struggle with quality, not timing. Clinical care isn’t fast food. Trust takes time.\n\n3) The 10-min everything app for healthcare is lazy ambition dressed up with VC money. Healthcare isn’t a SKU game but it’s complex, regulated, and hard to standardize like groceries. Great for funding buzz, terrible for trust and real outcomes.\n\nFew thoughts if you really are passionate to build in healthcare. \nTrust > velocity.\nSpeed isn’t everything.\nInfra & people ops > APIs.\nReliability > 10-min hacks.\nHealth is longitudinal & not transactional.\n\nGood luck if you're building something in Healthcare in India.",

      "Very insightful, particularly about sample collection and doctors, a good diagnosis and doctor after 2 days is anyday better than a doctor in 10 mins. If quick consultations were needed then second opinions would not have existed, it’s about one’s life afterall",
      " Good one. Speed can be a moat in healthcare, but it is not enough. It only matters when backed by reliability, credibility, and clinical accuracy. Without that, it is just fast delivery of poor outcomes Dilip Kumar",
      "The point about hygiene and reliability is so valid. Some companies rush reports, but after talking to a few doctors, I realised they don’t trust them because many results have been inaccurate.\n\nSo doctors often retest everything just to be safe.\n\nIn my opinion, building for healthcare in India has to be closely aligned with how primary care providers aka doctors operate.",
      "Healthcare isn’t a SKU. 10-min apps ignore what truly matters: care quality, compliance, and patient trust. We need to shift from speed obsession to well-being obsession. The future of healthcare isn’t “faster everything”, it’s smarter, safer, and more human.",
      "Devika Bhatia Ojaswini Bansal",
      "The best \"10-minute\" healthcare would be an ALS Ambulance connected to a Command center where a dedicated or a clan of ER Physicians could triage asap. This will also ensure the patient is getting the optimum care even when stuck in traffic.   ",
      "Loved this, Dilip. While the 10-min-fix fad grabs headlines, the real challenge in Bharat is access to qualified doctors, not just speed. At #ZiffyHealth, we're going beyond the buzz — building #eclinics and #telehealth infra that actually reach the rural and semi-urban population. It's slow, gritty, and full of learning — but we’re here to solve real problems.",
      "💡 Great insight\n You've captured a deep truth about healthcare startups—commendable insight.\nHealthcare isn't a fast-moving consumer sector; it demands precision, trust, and long-term infrastructure. We’re in the same space, working on this exact challenge. But unfortunately, many investors don’t yet see the vision—so we've chosen the path of bootstrapping.\n\nMedMEU is India’s first truly integrated healthtech platform—from blood test booking for patients to lab software, logistics, and support for diagnostic centers.\nWe don’t just connect—we enable the entire ecosystem.\n\nOur business model isn’t built for hype. It’s built for resilience.\nAnd we’re confident—our impact will speak louder than any pitch.",
      "Deeply insightful!",
      "This 10 min healthcare delivery is just the thing we are doing since last 2 years at The Society Clinic \n\nAnd our outcomes are\n\n1) healthcare is 24*7 job so don't go for zepto or blinkit kind of approach of morning to night, it will dilute the purpose,\n\n2) the thing one need in or below 10 mins is primary care or emergency care, when you need dressing or injection support for stone pain/dog bite you need it immediately. In case of emergency you just need right support before ambulance arrives\n\n3) for any preventive need you need quality and right guidance and not the speed,\n\n4) for doctor consultation physical delivery is all times not possible or practically possible, but you need right technology to have right doctor support\n\n5) technology is enabler here and not the core because AI will not give injection or do dressing, you need quality people, but yes good technology or AI will smoothen the processes,\n\n6) healthcare support is a combination of speed and quality plus personal touch, so everything is in 10 mins is practically a bad idea...\n\nAn experience is behind this because in last 2 years, we have 60+ emergencies in avg 4 mins, 4000+ doctor consultations on time and 30000+ nursing care day in day out at The Society Clinic",
      "Dilip Kumar This breakdown is gold. As someone actively building in the healthcare and compliance space, I can’t agree more. Healthcare is not a race, it’s a responsibility.\n\nSpeed has its place, but trust, hygiene, and infrastructure are the real game-changers. Instead of chasing “faster,” we should focus on “better” Better diagnostics, better last-mile care, better training, and better coordination. Especially in India, where healthcare isn’t just a service, it’s often the first line of defense for millions.",
      "How about solving the healthcare challenges of Rural India. Affordable, accurate diagnostics and lab solutions at convenience can save millions from premature death. Also, access to a specialist doctor is at least 100KMs/4 hours away for most of the rural India. There are ways it can be solved.",
      "Same aggregator model, just packaged differently. Many choose this model mainly to avoid taking any real responsibility.",
      "Thanks for sharing, Dilip",
      "Sir I am working on a smartphone and other  daily use device hygiene related model. We will going to install our  automatic outlet in all tier 1 and tier 2 cities first I can't say all things in here.  Please give your valuable opinion on it. Is it good model? I know execution is important than idea.  But in here I can't tell  execution of my model.",
      "Dilip Kumar the breakdown is thoughtful as always. But being Involved in building India’s 30-minute medicine delivery infra, I’ll say this: people underestimate how much consumers value certainty, not just speed. For chronic patients, new parents, and even GenZ — reliable 30-min delivery isn’t a gimmick, it’s becoming an expectation.\n\nThose who dismiss this shift today might just miss what will be table stakes tomorrow.",

      "Thanks for sharing, Dilip Kumar this is the clarity we all need 🙌🏻💯",
      "On the rapid diagnostics part, its also crucial to have the right reagents being used for testing, lesser error margins, reliability of the results that about rapid results availability.\n\nMicrowave mindset is not transferrable exactly :)",
      "Few of my observations:\n\n1. Medicine Delivery has active players, but profitability is a myth. The SKU mix is complex, and full prescriptions are rarely available. If customers still need to step out to complete their purchase, the convenience breaks down.\n\n2. Scheduled Drugs need prescriptions, but there’s no real gatekeeping. Anyone can upload a prescription, there’s little to no verification (last I used). In theory, even a kid could order sleeping pills. Plus, some essential drugs aren’t deliverable, adding more friction.\n\n3. Online doctor consults are broken. Diagnosis quality is hit or miss. Often, it’s junior doctors and patients spam chats, making it impossible to justify doctor costs. It just becomes unsustainable.\n\n4. Healthcare is inherently trust-based. When people are spending money on health, they choose trust not the apps. That's why hospitals and local practitioners still win.\n\nLastly, healthcare is largely a grey-area and practitioners do not want to loose that control.",
      "Dilip Kumar 🩺 “Trust beats speed every time.”\nYour breakdown nails it—healthcare isn’t BlinkIt for Band-Aids.\n✅ 30–60 min medicine delivery is plenty for most: chronic refills or acute needs fit here.\n✅ Diagnostics & home nursing? That’s about quality—sterile pickups, skilled phlebotomists, reliable EMRs—not flashy scooters.\n🚫 10‑min ambulances/doctors? Traffic and triage beat your ETA every time. Healthcare isn’t fast food; it’s custom‑tailored care.\nYour advice to value trust, infrastructure, ops, and reliability over hype is absolutely on point.\nStriking that balance—“Ola for nurses,” not “Blinkit for bandages”—could be the foundation of a sustainable healthcare play in India.",
      "Absolutely correct Dilip Kumar Sir, I am in healthcare industry for last three decade and for last 3 years with Sarathi Healthcare, served 5500+ parents at their home. Never ever found the need to \"instant delivery\" in healthcare. Yes, the reliable, trustworthy & passionate timely service is all about required in healthcare.",
      "Always on point! Dilip Kumar",
      "Love this, Dilip",
      "Great points overall. \nHowever few changes can make huge impact.\n1. a 3-hour sample collection (between 2-6pm) and 4- 6 hour report delivery can enhance care in acute infections like Dengue, Urine infections, prolonged cough.\n2. a 30-min nurse visit (if priced right) could be a great opportunity even in Tier 1 cities, patients wait hours for basics like injections, catheter mgmt etc. \n3. Scheduled home care also has huge potential, like Swiggy Scheduled, not fast but predictable and trusted.",
      "Thanks for sharing, Dilip",
      "We are building something, really not instant delivery. Our GG guides medicine delivery when it's mandatory. Connecting dots for family.",
      "Health care is a different animal..\n\nEducation at ground level is missing for a good part of Bharat.\n\nAll Healthcare companies are pro active in nature ..we need a reactive solution also which will only happen when the hinterlands are also given basic facilities.\n\nBefore we deliver medicines/doctor in less than  10 minutes, let's educate Bharat in less than 10 minutes with short viral videos of self hygiene, self care, drinking clean water, clean homes, clean streets, eat right, exercise and we will see a new and healthy India.\n\nAnyone thinking on those lines 🤔 might see a great solution for the future of Bharat",
      "If one has  to see  a doctor in 10 mins then he better be in the ER room of a well equipped hospital . Never know , the patient may be having an impending cardiac arrest.",
      "Dilip Kumar Great insights on the quick commerce healthcare trend in India! Your breakdown nails the balance between innovation and practicality. I completely agree that trust, reliability, and robust infrastructure are critical for sustainable healthcare delivery. As an RCM professional, I see immense potential in optimizing backend operations—be it EMR integration for on-demand nursing or streamlined logistics for diagnostics—to ensure quality care over speed. The focus on longitudinal care over transactional fixes is spot-on.\nBuilding scalable healthcare solutions requires aligning technology with regulatory compliance and patient-centric outcomes. Excited to connect with innovators prioritizing trust and operational excellence in this space! #HealthcareInnovation #RCM #HealthcareManagement #DigitalHealth #PatientCare",
      "When blinkit came people said same why grocery in 10 minutes but today realities are different so no guru can guess what will work and what will not, market is the only Guru",
      "Ayesha Jhunjhunwala links to some of what you were saying the other day!",
      "There are other aspects of healthcare also..\nAn urbanclap for healthcare & its offshoots\n\nNurses for elderly care & ailing\nCertified physiotherapist / yoga / exercise instructors\nMidwife\nNannies for babies",
      "Dilip Kumar This is one of the most grounded takes I’ve seen on healthcare x speed in India. We’re building Vitalyzer™ with the same mindset not chasing 10-minute gimmicks, but focusing on accuracy, hygiene, and trust in diagnostics. Speed without reliability is dangerous in health. The challenge isn’t delivering fast it’s delivering right.\nCurious: what kind of infra do you think still needs to be built if we’re serious about scaling this responsibly across Tier 2 & 3 cities?",
      "Great breakdown. A few complementary thoughts that might be worth layering in:\n• Care navigation – Access is one part, but helping patients know what to do next is often where real value lies. Especially important in chronic and post-acute care.\n• Clinical accountability at the last mile – Whether it’s a home nurse or a teleconsult, accountability and escalation protocols are often underdeveloped in speed-first models.\n• Health data interoperability – Without some form of continuity in records, faster care can actually increase risk. Building with safety nets matters more than timelines.\n",
      "A 10-minute service might be fine for a simple issue, but it’s risky if it becomes the norm for more complex cases. \n\nHealth is multifaceted, and some problems require more than just a quick fix. They need deeper investigation, long-term care, and ongoing support. \n\nA quick diagnosis leading to Superficial treatment carries the risk of missing underlying issues due to lack of time or thorough examination. Plus, it could lead to a greater reliance on technology and less emphasis on the doctor-patient relationship, which is vital for trust and comprehensive care.",
      "I completely agree with your insights. At Just What Works, while we’re (I and Nikhil Khurana, PhD)  not delivering in 10 minutes, we're focused on minimalism in our products, ensuring they meet essential human needs effectively.",
      "Ah yes, because nothing says “trust” like a doctor who’s just a click away and probably on a scooter!  \n",
      "Absolutely loved this breakdown. As someone building at the intersection of healthcare and immersive tech with MadVR Solutions Private Limited, I couldn’t agree more, speed without clinical integrity is a dangerous game. In healthcare, trust compounds, not delivery speed. The real opportunity lies in reimagining care infrastructure, not just timelines. We’re seeing it firsthand in how simulation-based training is redefining learning outcomes in surgical education. Health isn’t about “instant,” it’s about “impact.” Let’s build for that.",
      "Founders building solutions needing a problem to be solved. \n\nThat's the stupid trap, many first time founders fall prey to. Even I have been to.",
      "As always, great insightful post Dilip Kumar Sir",
      "Insightful Dilip. I pick up the first: Trust>> Velocity and would extend it from how you serve your clients further to how you build your business. \nEven though our primary business is eldercare (which ahs big overlaps with healthcare), our learning over 10 years is that if anytime there is a tradeoff, trade speed for building trust, any time all the time. That is the enduring currency which matters and it must be given time. In another 10 years we may know if this was right!",
      "Thanks for sharing, Dilip and see \nwww.credihealth.com",
      "It's a lovely take, Dilip Kumar ! \n\nHealthcare is a wide space with multiple  challenges to solve. The fundamental problem in India is lack of adequate doctors, nurses, attendants (especially well trained ones), facilities and so on. While multiple folks are solving for the meds, diagnostics, tele-consulting, equipment, etc. the true challenge lies in solving for affordability, quality, reliability and trust around the workforce providing medical services at your home.",
      "In healthcare, trust is the real fast track because no one wants their well-being delivered like groceries. Build for outcomes, not outrageously fast ETAs.",
      "This is such a clear and much-needed perspective on healthcare innovation in India! The hype around “10-minute everything” definitely oversimplifies the complex, trust-driven nature of healthcare services. Dilip Kumar",
      "bang on! cant agree more Dilip Kumar",
      "Unfortunately for many, the primary objective is the commercial outcome. Thanks for sharing this Dilip Kumar",
      "Insightful post, Dilip — and yes, “10-min healthcare” makes for a killer pitch headline.\n \nThough honestly, if you're seeing 10 startups a week doing this, do share — we've been building in this space and can barely count half that with any real traction.\n- Let’s not forget — no one “needed” 10-min groceries either, until suddenly bananas became more urgent than broadband.\n\n- Urban consumption has a way of turning absurdities into expectations.\n\n- True, 90% of healthcare doesn’t need speed. But for the 10% that does — emergency meds, critical blood tests, or that dreaded 7AM fasting sample — speed becomes habit-forming convenience.\n\n-At Zet Health, we’ve learned that trust is the baseline, not a differentiator. But speed isn’t evil — it just needs solid infra: trained staff, reliable logistics, and clinical protocols.\n\n-So before we throw speed-focused healthcare under the ambulance, let’s remember — 10% of lives improved is still impact.\n\nTL;DR:\n Trust matters.\n Speed helps.\n And no, we’re not building “Blinkit for bandages”…\n But Rapido for phlebotomists? Why not.",
      "This makes so much sense Dilip! As a regular user, I don’t need everything in 10 minutes. I just want reliable service, proper hygiene, and the right guidance. Healthcare should be built for care — not just convenience 👍 ",
      "I work in a health setup in a clinic run by a gynecologist. I manage the social media as well as write health articles  ( reviewed by the doctor). The clinic offers online consultation as well as direct physical  consultations at the clinic.\n I have realized that patients prefer  to consult online with a doctor who they know they can contact physically, if necessary. They can verify the authenticity and qualifications of the doctor. \nOnline consultations with doctors who may not be as qualified or reliable as  mentioned on the website is not preferred. \nThe clinic is doing quite well  online as well as offline.",
      "Absolutely agree — speed isn’t the holy grail in healthcare. In reality, most D2C healthcare plays today are built around discounts.\n\nAnd let’s be honest — if a customer gets a better deal elsewhere, they’ll switch. That’s not trust, that’s transaction.\n\nMeanwhile, hospitals and doctors still anchor the system — and rightly so. They hold the context, history, and continuity that true longitudinal care demands.\n\nWould love your thoughts: are we underestimating the value of long-term care relationships in the race for convenience?",
      "Its like the commercial movies: 1 superhit and then we will be plagued by same formula & combinations greedily-mindlessly-factory-made for years.",
      "Foucsing on trust, reliashibility, and the human touch creates lasting health solutions, Dilip Kumar",
      "This is a highly intellectual post among so much of cringe.\nI am glad my feed has this.\n\nWe (India) chase the wrong goals while following trends...\nA 'trend' like 10 min once solved some core problem - coriander, masalas, protection, party snacks, pizza, powerbank etc.\n\nA 'trend' like smartification and adding smartness to devices once solved some core problem - being able to get more out of the device thru it's data output.\n\nBut, riding a trend bandwagon gets VC money is what I see... I am not seeing it getting converted into sustainable, strong businesses though.",
      "I was one of the first online diagnostic startups in 2017, so i understand this market well.\nThe problem with home blood collection is the Hematology and Infection tests which constitute the majority volume of the tests and need results in 2-3 hours max. \nThe Established players are largely focusing on Biochemistry and other high value tests which are not that urgent, but all of them put together, barely cover 15-20% of the market. \nThis is the real problem in Diagnostics.",
      "Can any startup convert patient care in 10 min?",
      "Finally, a realistic take on healthcare delivery. Loved the clarity: trust > speed. Healthcare needs depth, not just velocity. Dilip Kumar",
      "Love this. So true. Lot of the time, people take some model which has clicked in other industry or vertical and try to come up with new ideas into a space where not required. If one can take a pause, think deeply from the pains of the end user perspective, we can do wonders.",
      "Hey Dilip, just a random thought. This has struck me a few times when I have waited in the worst of Bangalore traffic and have seen ambulances struggle to reach hospitals on time. How about a model like Sarla Aviation  doing flying ambulances at least with the bigger hospitals where the terraces seem big enough to have a small helipad of sorts? Simply thinking from the lens of what we could do to save critical lives in the minute that matters the most",
      "Dilip Kumar it is very precise n nicely put. It should give little insight to lot of people who want to just jump in to healthcare and take their bite, then fast to offload the idea to some investor with numbers and pocket quick bucks without realising it’s complexity and deep understanding and later leading to shutdown.",
      "Impressive volume, Dilip Kumar . That variety must give you a sharp edge in spotting real potential. Hearing how you filter and prioritize amid the noise would be fascinating—your process could guide many founders.",
      "Connect them to each other, they may deluver it.",
      "Fully agree",
      "What are your thoughts about developing football in the country! the most popular sport in the world and least sponsored across india",
      "Most cities need ambulances. Period. ",
      "Totally agree with this. From what I’ve seen, delivering medicines in 10 minutes in metro cities just isn’t practical — traffic is a major hurdle. More importantly, there are serious compliance requirements when it comes to prescription drugs. Sure, you can maybe manage OTC products quickly, but if you're truly following the rules and regulations, 10-minute delivery for prescription drugs just doesn’t add up.",
      "Totally agreespeed isn’t the fix for everything in healthcare. Trust and reliability win every time. Love the point about local chemists already filling the gap...sometimes we over-engineer what’s already working. #healthcareinnovation #buildsmarternotfaster",
      "I see predicament here. Health care is not disease care which seems to be in all of our hidden brain. Let’s talk to real doctors who are invested in “ Healthcare”. One is right here Mr Dilip Kumar!",
      "Dilip Kumar Finally, someone said it straight.\n\t• Healthcare isn’t about speed.\n\t• It’s about trust, consistency, and context.\n\nPoints that really landed with me:\n→ Discovery > Delivery.\n→ Quality > Quantity.\n→ Infra & people ops > vanity timelines.\n\nAlso, most people confuse convenience with care.\nYour local chemist, nurse, and lab technician already solve 80% of what these 10-min apps are chasing — just not in VC-friendly slides.\n\nQuestion worth asking:\nAre we solving healthcare problems or investor pitch problems?\n\nThanks for sharing this breakdown. Much needed clarity.\n\n#BuildWhatMatters #HealthcareIndia #TrustOverHype #LongGame",
      "What we need is healthcare for animals. The services are so bad even if you pay through your nose Dilip Kumar \nWe need intensive care \nWe need hospitals \nWe need ambulances \nWhy 10 mins ? Because animals cannot speak. Suddenly we see a stray on the road badly hurt what do I do ? Can I get a ambulance in 10?",
      "Dilip Kumar For medicine delivery, inventory discovery is quite important. Something which Dunzo used to do well. As a customer, I don't want to roam around 5 different pharmacy before I can find my medicines, delivery is a delight not must have.",
      "Saddened by the state that nobody wants to help build the dtrong foundation that our country needs. The very basic lack of having enough data in healthcare is scarier than anything else.\nAttended a small get together recently only to realise that even the govt doen't want to prioritise this stating it has bigger challenges on hand (obvious- however, this too is equally important and yet being sidelined)",
      "Healthcare needs trust, not just tech.\n Infra, people, and reliability matter more than speed.\n Because health isn’t a transaction — it’s a journey.",
      "Trust takes time :\n\nFor those in a hurry, health isn't your game...find another",
      "Dilip Kumar How about preventive healthcare,  post discharge support,  assisted regular OPD and  scheduled recovery check . Home based Monitoring through Control and Command Centers ?",
      "Definitely worth reading",
      "Personal opinion - the only velocity problem statement in healthcare is ambulance - rest all doesn’t require solving",
      "This is the clarity the sector needs. ",
      "So an ambulance?",
      "\"Not everything needs to be sped up\"\nLoved the insight!",
      "Man, can I say that I love you, or perhaps the honesty. Thank you so much for saying this out loud Dilip Kumar \nHealthcare isn't commerce and it shouldn't be treated like that.",
      "Healthcare needs trust, not just tech-enabled urgency.",
      "Finally, a realistic take on healthcare in India. It’s not about 10-minute gimmicks, it’s about sustainable, high-trust solutions.",
      "Absolutely nailed it! 👏 Healthcare is way more complex than quick delivery startups make it out to be. Trust and reliability should always come before speed. It’s refreshing to see someone call out the hype and focus on what truly matters — quality care, proper infrastructure, and meaningful patient outcomes. Looking forward to seeing more thoughtful innovation in this space! ",
      "Insightful cuts through hype—healthcare isn’t a race, it’s a relationship. Trust, quality, and continuity will always beat shortcuts and scooters in the long run",
      "I agree, Dilip, matching the right doctor, ensuring a clean blood sample, showing up with the right equipment those aren’t “10-min” problems, they’re trust problems, and trust is what healthcare actually runs on.",
      "I agree, Dilip, convenience can bring you users but only reliability keeps them especially when it comes to health!",
      "Brilliantly articulated and refreshingly honest Dilip Kumar\n\nHealthcare isn't a race to the doorstep — it's a journey of trust, precision, and care. The obsession with speed often ignores the very core of what patients need: reliability, empathy, and safety.\n\n\"10-min healthcare\" may make headlines, but 10-year trust is what truly drives outcomes. The reminder that health is longitudinal, not transactional couldn't be more timely.\n\nThis is the kind of clarity the ecosystem needs — thank you for cutting through the noise. ",
      "I enjoyed reading the post, and someone had to say it. Through my experience, I've learned that people don't want fast healthcare instead, they want accessible healthcare that actually works.\n\nI've watched people chase quick fixes for months, only to find lasting change when they commit to longer-term relationships with practitioners who understand their patterns.\n\nThe real gaps I see:\n-Finding the right practitioner, not just any available one\n-Building trust over time, not rushing consultations\n-Integrating mind-body approaches that require patience\n-Creating continuity of care, not episodic band-aids\n\nSpeed optimizes for convenience. Healthcare optimizes for outcomes. The best healing happens when someone feels truly seen and understood - that takes time, not technology. \n\nWhat's your take on how investors can better evaluate healthcare startups beyond the \"10-minute\" metric? Dilip Kumar?",
      "Amazing thoughts Dilip Kumar, we are organising a panel with founders developing home health and Q commerce in health on Monday at Antler's office - https://lu.ma/8m6i1trk .Hoping to get ground reality, and founders pov!!",
      "I second that, Dilip, solving for speed without solving for context is dangerous!",
      "So true, Dilip! Trying to compress trust & empathy like emotions into a delivery window is where most healthcare startup ideas are going wrong.",
      "Speed, when paired with expertise and trust, is a winning formula, especially in healthcare. We at Zet Health are building the same.  \n\nIn diagnostics, timing matters. A phlebotomist isn’t just delivering a service; they enter your home, perform a skilled and precise procedure, ensure you are at ease, and transport the samples to the lab within the required time window.\n\nThat’s what makes healthcare delivery fundamentally different from any other form of quick commerce.\n\nThere are genuine clinical scenarios like Arterial Blood Gas tests  where 10-minute collections are not a luxury, but a necessity.\n\nWhen the quality, price, and trust remain consistent, but one option delivers faster the choice is clear. Consumers are evolving, and so are their expectations. Quick commerce is the new normal ! \n\nDilip Kumar would love to connect and discuss more.",
      "Really appreciate this clear-eyed perspective! As a medical officer and someone deeply interested in healthcare innovation, I often find the tech narratives disconnected from ground realities. Healthcare isn’t just about speed — it’s about trust, trained hands, and systemic accountability. We need solutions that strengthen the roots, not just chase valuations. Thank you for breaking this down so thoughtfully.",
      "Har teesra founder bolta hai —\n “Game changer bana rahe hai.”\nPar pitch deck dekhte hi lagta hai —\n Same game, same template, same buzzwords.\nStartup nahi, startup cosplay chal raha hai.",
      "Agree with the thought processes.esp Trust over speed .\n\nMy 2 “paise “\n\n 10min doc consult .\nUnlike the west ,consulting a specialist isnt a herculean task here.can just walk into a clinic and meet a neurologist in less than an hour .\n\nola/Zomato Nursing care seems interesting. For various reasons (poor unit economics,trust )home care hasnt picked up well in india yet.still that has got good prospect .",
      "Right doctors with unbiased advice is critical need, technoly/business should focus on solve this basic problem.",
      "I am thankfully and honestly proud that we have not made any such commitments in our pitch either to partners or VC or angels: \nhere’s what we don’t promise:\n1. Lightning-fast deliveries\n2. 10-minute magic\n\nBecause health deserves more than haste.\n\nHere’s What We Do Promise:\n1. On-demand care ask, and we’ll deliver within a reliable, realistic time frame\n2. Native, local deliveries you can count on\n3. A trusted network built for your peace of mind\n4. Trusted, trained and secure\n\nI might be sounding bold, but hey, who better to pitch the vision than the founder himself?",
      "“Clinical care isn’t fast food.” ← That line says it all.\n\nIn healthcare, trust compounds slower, but lasts longer.\n\nInfra-first thinking is underrated and desperately needed."

      "Dilip Kumar Love the honesty in this. The journey from building to backing is never linear but it brings a depth of understanding that only comes from having been in the trenches yourself. Founders need more investors who have seen both sides. More power to you and looking forward to seeing the kind of founders you’ll help shape.",

His transformation from a founder to someone who empowers other founders is emblematic of a significant shift towards ecosystem building. It also points to a broader trend of entrepreneurs who, after multiple startups, choose to contribute back by funding and mentoring others. This cycle of giving back not only enhances the startup environment but also provides a pathway for sustainable entrepreneurship. Moreover, Dilip's openness to conversations with budding founders can inspire more inclusive dialogues, ensuring that diverse ideas get the attention and support they require to flourish.

The sad part is that nearly 60% of these deaths are preventable with better care. \n\nThis is where I believe AI in healthcare can truly make a difference. \nWe can develop predictive models for at-risk pregnancies using maternal health data. Build remote monitoring systems that flag early signs of preterm labor. Even use image based diagnostics to catch neonatal infections before they turn fatal.\n\nI hope more people building for healthcare in India focus on solutions that can detect risks early and save lives.

However I afraid it will be limited to economically well parents only.\n\nIn India significant reduction infant mortality rates can be made only when proximity of public health systems and its efficiency improves so it is accesable to every Indian.\n\nGovernment is spending crores to the in the form of free medicines, vaccines, nutritious food suppliment for the both mothers,  and infants. Still it need lots efforts improve its efficiency and its proper distribution.\n\nThis effectiveness public health system varies accross States as well as by Districts.\n\nAnother important factor we should be aware, that most of the births will officially get noticed or registered when the birth happens in a any form of private or public health system, or when parents willingly or responsibly do it. According  registratiom departmen more than 7% of births not get registered in 2019 alone. When birth itself not get registered  or officially counted, the just think about the actual the statistics of still births or infants not survived.",

      "This is not the news most people expect in this age of technology. \n\nWhile AI can help, it needs good data. Unfortunately, today the healthcare systems in India are fragmented and hence extremely challenging to get that medical data needed to train AI and then retrain AI with newer advancements.\n\nIndia needs connected healthcare system, so that the data can be exchanged countrywide.  And AI can then to be used to predict health issues much earlier, which would result in timely remiditation and care.",

      "This is truly heartbreaking, Dilip Kumar. My heart goes out to the family who experienced such a devastating loss. It's painful to know that so many of these tragedies are preventable with timely care and intervention.\n\nThank you for shedding light on this critical issue. I completely agree — leveraging AI and technology in maternal and neonatal care can be a game-changer. We need more focus, innovation, and collaboration in this space to ensure no parent has to endure such unimaginable grief again.",
      "Dilip Kumar, such a strong post. And you’re right, if there’s one space where AI has to prove its worth, it’s frontline, real-world problems like this. Predictive care, early alerts, better maternal support, the tech exists, we just need the will and the focus to deploy it where it truly matters. \n\nNo parent should pay the price for gaps that data and compassion can close.",
      "Extremely sad to hear Dilip Kumar. Honestly this was part of the vision when we started building BabyChakra | Good Glamm Group. Life had different plans for the company. If you do come across entrepreneurs building in this space with RMS/ predictive analysis for triage/early interventions pls feel free to intro them to me as well: happy to help them ideate.  ",
      "Some tragedies aren’t fate, they’re failures in early detection. If AI can flag a fake email, it should damn well be able to flag a life at risk. 💔",
      "This is a problem where technology alone will not be sufficient but technology as an aid to policy could be the solution. The technology solution will need to be part of a policy. To do this I believe the startup will need power brokers in its board. Access to care, social conditioning, public awareness…all these will need to partner for technology to be helpful, I think.",
      "10 years back my colleagues were piloting a project for the same cause even before the AI fad. Ultimately corporates want profit and such projects are killed. The challenge is who will fund public health.",
      "Dilip Kumar This is so unfortunate. Technology—especially AI—has the potential to radically shift the curve. From early risk detection in pregnancy to timely intervention in neonatal care, predictive and preventive tools can empower clinicians and health workers like never before. True, it’s complicated but it’s doable one step at a time. \nI am proud that companies like   Resolute AI  are working towards prevention and better health outcomes.\nThank you for bringing this conversation to the forefront.",

      "Prevalence of post partum depression is 22-30% in India. Sadly a lot of mothers who go through losing an infant and who go through miscarriages develop symptoms of PPD that are untreated and not recognised. This adds on to the misery parents feel of losing their children. We have seen patients who have been depressed for over 30 years. While we need strong practices to prevent neonatal infections and hence fatality, we also need strong resources for parents who do go through this trauma",
      "So sorry to hear about your friend’s loss Dilip Kumar. Another unfortunate fact is that out of these birth defects & rare genetic conditions drive an estimated 20 % of those deaths. We don't even have a newborn screening program when countries are making the Whole Genome Sequencing mandatory for newborns? We would have to start somewhere.\n\nWe are developing AI based early screening genomic solutions specifically for NICU babies and advocating for mandatory testing but a national level newborn screening program is an urgent need.\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/jun/20/all-babies-in-england-to-get-dna-test-to-assess-risk-of-diseases-within-10-years",
      "India accounts for 25% of global premature births linked to air pollution, and such preterm births are the #1 cause of newborn mortality worldwide. I believe air pollution in India shouldn't just be treated as an environmental issue; it’s a public health emergency, especially for expectant mothers and newborns, requiring stricter actions from the government. ",
      "Preventive Diagnostics is the need of the hour. And AI integration with medical sector makes it possible.\nThere are already brands like Nura offering AI-based preventive Diagnostics in India. \n\nThe time now is to also offer maternity solutions like this.",
      "Heartbreaking, Dilip. Yes, most infant deaths (almost a million in India) are preventable with the right therapy. Besides predictive models, the ecosystem needs treatment options that can actually work in the skill and infra constrained healthcare environments where most babies are born. The right technology can save thousands of lives, as we have demonstrated with our product Saans that has treated and saved over 75,000 babies with lifesaving respiratory support. Hope entrepreneurs in India focus as much on physical technologies as they do on data and AI- we need holistic tech development to transform care in India. Best, siraj!",

      "May the little angel soul rest in peace. Prayers for the parents. It is a difficult topics with differentiated care and practices around India. AI and Data can find a way to identify high risk cases. Age, regions, trimester data, and other factors can give a score and one can help reduce probability of loss.",
      "Agreed. The loss of a newborn is heartbreaking, and even more so when we know so many of these deaths are preventable.\nThat’s exactly where startups like Janitri and Spotsense are stepping in with purpose and precision.\nJanitri is reimagining maternal and fetal care through affordable, AI-powered monitoring tools that work in both rural and urban setups. Their wearable devices and dashboards are helping frontline workers detect early warning signs in pregnancies—pre-eclampsia, fetal distress, delayed labor—before they turn fatal.\nSpotSense is another game-changer. They’re building low-cost, point-of-care diagnostics for neonatal sepsis—one of the biggest killers in the first few weeks of life. Using saliva-based biosensors, they’re detecting infections faster than conventional blood culture systems.\n",
      "I am sure your intentions are good, but you are connecting unrelated issues.\na) Please look into SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome). We still haven't identified a definitive cause.\nb) Our infant mortality rate has nothing to do with AI. It is primarily due to maternal malnutrition, which leads to premature births and sepsis. This is compounded by the inability of malnourished mothers to breastfeed, resulting in increased susceptibility to infections and stunting.\n\nAI in Healthcare can make a difference, but WE NEED SERIOUS EXPERTISE. Fitness Apps are neither AI, nor do they solve any serious Healthcare challenge. ",

      "Could late pregnancies be the reason? In which case, we need a socio-cultural solution rather than technology solution. ",
      "Dilip Kumar\nThis resonates deeply. I'm sorry for your friend's loss - losing a child is unimaginable.\nYou're absolutely right about the AI potential in healthcare, and I think the scope is even broader than the 2.5% post-birth mortality you mentioned.\nLooking at the complete picture in India: out of every 1,000 pregnancies, roughly 169 don't result in a healthy baby surviving the first year. This includes ~100 miscarriages, ~26 stillbirths, and ~43 infant deaths. That's nearly 17% of all pregnancies.\nWhat's particularly heartbreaking is how unprepared couples are for this reality. Most don't realize that pregnancy loss is this common, so when it happens, they're not just grieving - they're also completely blindsided and often blame themselves.",
      "An even bigger problem is maternal mortality,and the two factors are linked.\nChildbirth and pregnancy are not classified as a disease under insurance yet so many lives are lost for no reason at all.\nThe population explosion makes this an unattractive niche,but it still lives at stake",
      "Dilip Kumar It is very unfortunate, that anyone should go through this. There are many such health problems that Indians and the developing world are facing. These require deep technical solutions comprising physical diagnostics coupled with AI. AI alone unfortunately cannot make a difference in vast majority of such cases.",
      "It’s painful to think preventable loss is still this common.\nIf we can track a package in real-time, we should be able to track maternal risk too. AI has the power, but it needs the right intent behind it.",
      "Yes it is common and the 1st time I came across the stats, it was shocking. Even maternal mortality rates are very high in India.",
      "AI may not have the perfect solutions yet, but people like Vaishnavi Kulkarni are building scalable solutions to bridge these gaps in maternal and infant health.",

      "Such a heartbreaking post to read. Thank you for bringing attention to this. But like you said, this is also where innovation can truly shift the story. Earlier this year, I shared a post on \"Healthy beginnings and Hopeful Futures\" exploring the data on MMR and NMR in India, the leading causes, and how timely care can change outcomes for mothers and newborns. Sharing it here in case it adds to the conversation: https://www.linkedin.com/embed/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:7314930909911085058 ; Because with the right focus, we can move from loss to possibility one early intervention at a time.",
      "Heartbreaking to hear, Dilip! Jane Marie Chen's Embrace Global is one of the most ground breaking studies and work that I have ever found across the globe. It's a landmark design-thinking project that we discuss while facilitating and designing for user while keeping empathy at the core.. Take a look! Note: This is pre-dominantly focused on pre-mature babies.",
      "That is difficult to read. My wife and I had a miscarriage very early in our first pregnancy, and that itself took a ton of resilience and external support to recover from. The death of a newborn -- gee, can't even imagine what your friend must be going through! \n\nThis said, early health risk detection is a tough area to crack. Whilst it makes sense theoretically and everyone buys into it at a notional level, not enough money is being put on the table for such interventions to succeed at scale. \n\nThis is, of course, speaking from personal experience of building Mindei's preventive and early detection tools from a mental health risk perspective.\n\nThat does not deter us from continuing to build, though. We need more voices and spaces to solve for preventive approaches - and hence, kudos to to you for everything you do. ",
      "We already have plenty of ways to identify and predict high-risk births/newborns. It’s honestly not rocket science. \n\nThe real challenge has been implementation and providing quality care in a public healthcare system setting. This is the case even when the newborns are already identified. Data is often altered/missed to avoid admitting these newborns, to drive the hospital mortality rate down. \n\nThere are proven solutions based on decades of research, but they are just not implemented well. Ansh is working on it. \n\nEarly diagnosis of newborn sepsis is missing. But then the challenge is low-cost market expectation leaving less incentive to heavily invest in research. An advance market commitment might solve this though. \n\nWould be curious to hear if Rainmatter would be interested in supporting either",
      "While AI can definitely help, some things need behavioural change. We often miss that technology alone is enough, we also have to invest in social capital. Jhabua of Madhya Pradesh, which suffers one of the highest infant mortality rates, see changing landscape with women leading nutritional sufficiency movement. (Shivganga Samagra Gramvikas Parishad) Which you Dilip, is rightly supporting through the Rain matter foundation.",
      "AI in healthcare - predictive models for at-risk pregnancies would be greatly needed to prevent premature infant deaths . I lost mine premature baby boy 1 year before , died due to unknown reasons. The doctor was clueless about this & could not say the precise reason. We don't have a perfect system to record the growth of infants during pregnancy issues in real time. This is much needed .The AI predictive healthcare system is the urgent need of time.",
      "Dilip This is absolutely heartbreaking to hear and a glaring reality of how high is the infant mortality rate. I would love to sit down with you and introduce you to some of the latest tech that my friends at EveryBaby are building. We really have to build in diagnostic hardware more than software only.",
      "Dr. Shantanu Pathak and team are doing something to address this with CareMother by Doto Health",
      "Yes, you are right. But this issue is severe in the rural areas. Even if AI is capable, penetrating the rural layers is a huge challenge. We still have a severe shortage of skilled nurses and neonatologists.\n\nAlso, AI is as good as the data it's trained on. If rural areas have this problem, they also don't have good data collection infrastructure and hence it will be very hard to build the AI that works for this particular challenge.",
      "Rationale isn’t based in reality. Healthcare system isn’t broken in detection, it is rigged in intent designed to loot. Doctors and hospitals are practicing financial triage. The SOPs and facilities are also far inferior than western and eastern counterparts. Much if that can be fixed.\nAI isn’t needed here, but on research that completely flips healthcare as we know it. Think nanobots, autonomous recovery chambers and surgical systems. Possibilities are endless.",
      "Neonatal mortality remains significantly higher in rural India (~1.5x urban). While national rates have dropped to ~25/1,000 live births (2021 numbers). The urban numbers are not that drastic, but still alarming. It also shows variations in states etc, like in urban karnataka it is 8/1000. Neonatal deaths occur many times due to sepsis which is preventable by rigorous hygeine at hospital and home. While the urban areas have better private sector hospitals, rural areas mainly depend on government infrastructure which is deplorable in many states. Many NGOs are working on this part, teaching hygeine to parents and working on best practices in hospitals. Predictive power of death from sepsis in Neonates are high with guidelines available which doctors are aware of. \nSo, I believe that neonatal mortality can be better prevented from best practices and pure hygeine , handwashing rather than AI models. More than that, the real place of need is rural india where penetration of basic technology is pretty low.\nJust my thoughts as a subject matter person!",
      "Very sad and It should not happen.\nDetecting risks in healthcare isn’t the hard part anymore. AI-driven predictive and mitigation tools are ready. The real challenge lies in adoption and monetisation.\n\nStartups like ours, #MonkDB, have built AI-native platform that can solve real problems. We’ve identified 30+ healthcare use cases and piloted several. Yet, we see limited traction, especially in India.\n\nHospitals hesitate to adopt, delay payments, or don't prioritise tech investment. Many startups risk dying before scaling.\n\nIt’s time to shift from passive interest to active integration because innovation is no longer optional in healthcare.\n#HealthTech #MonkDB #AIinHealthcare #MedTech #InnovationGap #DigitalHealth",
      "This is a topic very close to me as well. Dilip Kumar - Agreed AI can catapult the situation, but so far even the basic diagnostics (NABL Accredited or even otherwise) is not available in a very large area of our country. On a short term basis, proper nourishment and health checks during pregnancy period for the TO BE mother, neo natal and pediatric care for at least first 3 years along with care for new Mother can put big dent in IFMR numbers. \n\nThis can be done by Government, pro bono by individuals (One of my good friend - Shazin Siddiqui runs one such unit in BHOPAL), new age start ups (CureBay), and also established health care providers. ",
      "Alternatively, we need to make births less clinical (many hospitals over-medicalize it with unnecessary interventions). Pregnancy is not a disease. More humane and holistic care throughout the reproductive care continuum is as necessary as focused tech solutions in delivering optimal outcomes.",
      "You're right, Dilip. More than 700,000 children in India die before their fifth birthday every year. Most of it is preventable.\n\nWe see the same thing in cancer. Over 70 percent of cases are diagnosed too late. And when that happens, there's very little anyone can do. But if caught early, survival can be as high as 80 or 90 percent.\n\nAt Cancel the Cancer, this is what we're focused on. Build systems that don't wait for symptoms.\n\nAppreciate you putting this out there. It matters.🙏",
      "Completely agree Dilip Kumar \nEven still births for that matter\n\nMy Mom had a still birth, from all I know, it was due to her heart and blood pressure issues. I don't know if it was preventable, or if such cases are even preventive or not. \n\nBut I believe they can be. \n\nCurrently, India has the highest no. of stillbirths in the world (over 2.86 lakh annually).\nThe average rate of still births in India is even higher than the global average. And that says a lot about the state of maternal care and preventive care during pregnancy.\n\nAlthough, with AI & technology, we can build solutions that can bridge the gap between early awareness, intervention and loss.",
      "I hope the couple is holding on ok, and I hope like hell this rate goes down. In today’s day and age of technological advancement, no one should lose life other than to natural\nOld age.",
      "Reading this as a mom is heartbreaking. In urban India, we assume access means safety, but even here, things slip through the cracks, missed signs, rushed care, no follow-up. It’s devastating that something preventable can still become fatal. AI can help, but we also need systems that are more attentive, more humane, and that support parents instead of overwhelming them. No one should have to carry this kind of grief.",

      "It is unbearable to even attempt imagining the pain of the mother.\nWhile your post is in good intent, I don't think AI in healthcare is going to solve for the 0.25% (not 2.5%) IMR unless it is going to help the impoverished strata, where most infant deaths occur and we are yet to solve for basic healthcare access.",
      "Dilip Kumar check us out.\n\nhttps://www.hecco.ai/",
      "Dr Abhay Bang and Dr Rani Bang have worked in this area for last few decades in Gadchiroli district of Maharashtra. ",
      "Heartbreaking — and so important that you brought this to light, Dilip Kumar\n\nThe numbers are painful, but what’s worse is how avoidable many of these tragedies are. When 60% of infant deaths are preventable, it’s not just a statistic — it’s a call to action.\n\nAI has real potential here: not to replace care, but to extend its reach — especially in areas where infrastructure is thin. From early risk stratification to remote diagnostics, the tech already exists. What’s missing is deployment at scale, and the will to prioritize it.\n\nThere’s so much talent in India’s healthtech space. Hopefully this post nudges more of it toward problems that truly matter.",
      "Predictive models will need a large data set of longitudinal data: actual patient histories and real life events/outcomes, instead of established theories. Unfortunately this may be difficult as maternal healthcare is highly fragmented>getting continuous, reliable data may be a huge challenge> it easily gets lost out of the loop due to variety of reasons....preventive care is a sore thumb in AI.  I'd love to know your thoughts!",
      "Absolutely resonated with this. Having spent the last 20 years evaluating innovations, patents, and emerging tech (large part of my work has been in health tech), I can say that predictive models, AI diagnostics, remote monitoring, and historical health data modeling do have great potential to improve outcomes. But I think the biggest challenges are not due to the absence of such technologies particularly in Indian context. In fact, in many cases the risk is already known to doctors, to health workers, sometimes even to the family. Yet the tragedy still unfolds. Because of gaps in awareness, social and behavioral factors, resource limitations, infrastructure constraints, and lack of action for some other reasons. These are systemic, not technological, barriers. That said, technology must still be built, and smartly. Not just to predict, but to integrate meaningfully into care pathways .",
      "Dr. Shantanu Pathak - Thought of Doto's solution on reading the post.",
      "We have massive amounts of medical data across hospitals and clinics in India that lie unused. The big challenge is in building systems to collect and organise this data. If we can, the potential is huge. \n\nRahul Gandhi talked about working on this in his 2019 campaigns but no real progress has been made by anyone in this area yet as far as I know.",
      "Heartbreaking to read this and yet so important that we talk about it.\nYou're right, the potential of AI in maternal and neonatal care is massive. Early detection, personalized risk profiling, and faster intervention can truly move the needle.\nThank you for spotlighting this with the urgency it deserves."

Yesterday, 40+ founders came together to invest in something even more valuable than startup funding-their own mental, physical & emotional health. \n\nA random idea i posted online two weeks ago now has a shape & energy. I'll say it again- a founder’s health is the real moat of the business.\n\nThis isn’t just for our portfolio. It’s for every founder in India-whether you’re funded by us, by someone else, or by no one at all. No pitch decks. No filters. You just have to show up.\n\nWhy are we doing this? Because everyone talks about product market fit. But no one tells the founder: You are the most valuable IP in the company. Don’t burn out.\n\nWhich city should we do next?

However, we often face language barriers due to English, which sometimes limits our ability to express our potential fully.\n\nThe purpose of this comment is to convey that even if the language is different, what truly matters is the strength of the idea and the product.

Despite featuring talented players like PV Sindhu, Saina Nehwal, Kidambi Srikanth, Lakshya Sen, Satwik-Chirag, and others, we struggled to attract big-name supporters. Some celebrities, including Akshay Kumar and SRT who initially backed the league, eventually exited. We also reached out to another legend multiple times, but he only made a brief appearance in Season 5 without promoting the league.\n\nEvery season, we invited the Union Sports Minister to attend the inaugural match or finals, but he never attended. Even India's historic Thomas Cup win in 2022 didn't translate to increased support for badminton. Despite brainstorming with legendary coach Pullela Gopichand, we couldn't raise the sport's profile as we'd hoped. Although participation in the game increased significantly during this period, we ultimately couldn't achieve our goals and had to discontinue the league.\n\nIt's disheartening that as a nation, we often overlook our true heroes.",

      "Not today it has been so for a couple of years and all those who follow chess know it.",
      "Chess remains one of the few truly democratic sports, your FIDE rating alone determines your standing, free from politics or personal bias. Selection for national or international competitions is purely merit-based, leaving no room for lobbying or favoritism. \n\nUnfortunately, most other sports in India are still tangled in a web of stakeholders, where an athlete’s future often hinges on the decisions of a third party, decisions that can be influenced by everything except performance.",
      "while the recognition exists, it’s often limited to platforms where people are already interested in or aware of chess. What’s missing is the mass amplification and national celebration that other sports get, even for relatively minor events.",
      "But it's not that Chess is as famous as Cricket or any team sport for that matter.\n\nJust coz we are good at it doesn't make it a mass product.\n\nReminds of a lot of debates around  cringe content creators making more money than IITians (I don't find that discussion fair, but people are enjoying those conversations)",
      "Dilip Kumar As we all know , We the Indian's are Inventors of Chess !\n\nLet me share some interesting facts here:\n \nThe game of Chaturanga, which is considered the precursor to chess, originated in India during the Gupta Empire. Rather than being invented by one person, chess evolved over centuries from Chaturanga into the game we know today, Chaturanga traveled to Persia (modern-day Iran) and was transformed into Shatranj, which introduced significant changes. \n\nCricket's obsession eclipses chess due to its historical roots ( The British ), widespread appeal, and consistent international success. Cricket's glamour, entertainment value, and simpler gameplay make it more accessible and enjoyable for a wider audience, while chess, despite a recent surge in popularity and talent development, remains more niche. ",

The drama's all there",
      "Can't watch chess while having beer and chips. Can't \"act\" like hooligans while enjoying chess. Chess requires brain to even watch and understand. Hence.....",

When individuals are lactose intolerant, their bodies are unable to digest this sugar due to a deficiency of the enzyme lactase, leading to uncomfortable symptoms.\n\nGiven the existing high rates of lactose intolerance in India, estimated to be over 60% according to various studies, it's likely that many will seek dairy alternatives. The growing awareness of lactose intolerance is expected to drive interest in plant-based milk options, providing a potential solution for those looking to manage their dietary needs.\n\nReferences : \n\nhttps://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/lactose-intolerance-by-country\n\nhttps://www.fastandup.in/nutrition-world/lactose-intolerance-in-india/",

With 75% of Indians deemed to be  lactose intolerant and clear evidence that dairy consumption increase inflammation in the human body, no health conscious Indian should be consuming this adulterated junk anyway!!

      "This is blasphemous!!!",
      "I wonder if a combination of specific gravity, density, osmolarity and ph might differentiate some contaminants in milk at home setting using inexpensive detector. Because there is no dearth of possible contaninants, and the offenders will likely modify their game, a region level random testing using core labs (relatively more expensive instrumentation such as those used in airport screening but validated for milk) may be a more accurate and cost effective solution. Any consumer can choose to test their sample  occasionally for a cost (cheaper than buying and managing a home device). This can change the behavior of the offenders by making contamination harder to keep up with and more tranparent within society. Spread awareness of the importance of random testing and make testing labs available regionally. This can also be expanded to other food products that may fall in this category of risk. This kind of private testing might be an antidote to lack of centralized regulatory efforts by the government to address these issues.",

      "NDRI Karnal has developed many milk adulterations testing kits. In my point of view if you want to ensure people have pure dairy products, we need to focus on building hyperlocal d2c dairy supply chain to ensure fresh dairy products flows directly from rural to urban consumers without going through large scale centralised milk processing centres. At https://deshimoo.com/ we are moving in that direction one farmer at a time.",

Adulteration is not done at farm level, no farmer will adultrate (max water addition), , adulteration happnes further down the supply chain. \n\nMarketing slogans never match the required actions at backend, that is the problem. \n\nBy the way FSSAI has withdrawn the report which told 68% of the milk is adulterated.

      "Water is the most common, no side effect adulteration. \n\nTried the slant test for milk adulteration, it gave no clear results.\n\nThe flow speed and white trail were inconclusive. Since adulteration is a matter of percentage, we need a more accurate, preferably fuzzy output that can quantify it, not a digital one.\n\nFor eg, density is a good test. \nA 500ml of milk packet should weigh xx gms",
      "We are focused on beer, whiskey and brandy, the q line we see to buy milk vs beer tells the story, same with fruits.. sometimes the Qline to grab a beer bottle creates traffic issues on road..in Bangalore I see many wine shops even close to family areas..I think no one has any real interest in milk or fruits, if beer quality is not good then we catch it easily,  when it comes to milk..I doubt really who want to know how it got manufactured and what mixed in it..milk is surely polluted, as you said at least to protect our kids we need such investigations..",
      "Not just milk or dairy, the entire food industry is deeply broken because the foundation itself isn’t right. Whether it’s dairy, poultry, or farming, all of it needs a major reset.

      "Testing kits for consumers is a great marketing gimmick but does absolutely nothing to solve the problem. The problem is highly complex and includes the poor traceability of unorganised sector milk, poor point of collection testing kit availability (not the actual tech or product availability which is plentiful and reasonable - but the actual deployment of solutions at the collection point) and most importantly the absolutely horrendous pricing offered to dairy farmers by all players, particularly milk unions which then sets the standard for private players to compete against for the consumers money.",
      "A kit definitely empowers the consumer, but it also puts the burden of proof on them. What happens when a consumer gets a positive result? They enter a messy, confrontational dynamic with their local milkman or store with little to no legal recourse. We need to think of a \"solution\" that includes a clear, accessible path to action after the test as well.",
      "Jitendra Chouksey Maybe you can make such device for all of us. ",
      "Food adulteration is a serious issue in India, and it’s not limited to dairy. It’s also why we import our whey protein from Europe. Until we accept the reality of this problem and demand better, we’ll continue risking our health on a daily basis.",
      "A testing kit alone will not resolve the issue. The government is aware of these problems and has enacted laws to address them, so why not enforce these laws more rigorously? Additionally, why not treat the adulteration of food and medicine as a serious crime, comparable to genocide? This is akin to slowly poisoning the population, including those in law enforcement. ",

      "No wonder, Nation is suffering from metabolic disease pandemic; One side we are promoting awareness about health and running nationwide initiatives, on the other side we are allowing adulteration of this order. \nUnless we fix the food supply chain, we cannot become a healthy nation",
      "I recently read somewhere that the paneer we consume is also mostly adulterated. I didn't proceed to check any studies but the logic was strong. \n\nIs anything.. anything safe?",
      "With you on that one! One must also consider the fact that the modes and adulterants themselves may keep changing. Till early 2000's, it was more of traditional adulteration where people were more worried about simpler problems like \"is there water mixed in this milk?\". Of course synthetic milk existed, but wasn't as looming a menace. The following period till 2012, saw the rise of synthetic adulterants like hydrogen peroxide, formalin, and other nasties. Thereafter, with stringent crackdown by the apex body, adulteration shifted towards micro level localized infusions whereby tests had to be far more sensitive to detect the same when a small batch of adulterated milk was mixed with a larger quantity of milk. While consumer awareness is steadily on a rise, much to our delight, the makers of such kits must look at tackling 2 things continuously:\n(1) Stay abreast with any never-seen-before malpractices and create tests for them\n(2) Keep the users (read, consumers) continuously updated and aware of such changes",
      "Country Delight had started providing kits when they launched in the market :)\n\nPretty easy and DIY.",
      "There are many such kits available online. Country Delight's launch plan sent a testing kit with every first order. I still remember Nandini & amul milk failing all tests!",

      "Thanks for this Dilip, but I would partially agree on the last part. Why build a product to identify the adulteration? Why can't we fix this from root?",
      "Good one!",

      "Alternative solutions available now.",

      "Dilip Kumar: Country Delight built their entire brand around this \"testing kit\" \n\nI don't know the efficacy of it but most certainly they did a fantastic job. \n\nThe worst is now they have diluted the entire idea of unadulterated milk product to become Blinkit. "

    "text": "Doctors in India die earlier than their patients. I know it sounds crude but what it means is Indian doctors have a life expectancy that’s nearly 10 years shorter than the average Indian. And this is reported by Indian Medical Association. \n\nThe primary causes are Cardiovascular disease and infections. Ironically, the very things they work tirelessly to prevent.\n\nEndure 10-12 years of medical education with the only aspiration to save lives but be at the receiving end of stress, anxiety, and long working hours. And be a part of a system that doesn’t give them time to care for their own health. The average Indian doctor clocks 60–80 hours a week and approx 300-400 doctors die by suicide every year. Mostly because of the impossible expectations they carry. It takes 10+ years of study before a doctor sees their first salary.\n\nThey’re taught that saving lives is everything. After 10hrs+ of work, you can then go and figure your own personal health & family life. And after all this, they’re now told that AI will make them obsolete. That their jobs will be replaced by software tools because the system is inefficient.\n\nI meet atleast 50 companies a month that pitch AI solutions for healthcare. These tools matter and they can make processes faster and improve accessibility. No doubt Indian healthcare needs better processes and better tech. But what it needs more than anything is empathy.\n\nIndia’s hospitals are crowded and the health crisis is real. But what’s also been ignored is the mental and physical health of our doctors & medical staff. \n\nThis isn’t a rant against technology, AI or healthcare system. But a reminder to self and maybe a few who are reading this that without empathy and without recognizing the human cost, there will be no healthcare system left.",

      "Powerful reminder that healing isn’t just about better tech, it’s about better treatment of those who heal us. Empathy isn’t optional in healthcare; it’s foundational.",
      "I'm assuming this is because of the higher barriers to enter into the Medical field !!\n\nThe cost of Medical education is extremely high and most people cannot afford to invest that much into it, \nThe Government Medical colleges in India are very limited compared to the demand of doctors in the society !\n\nAnd the lack of Manpower and the scarcity of Specialized doctors makes it both a boon and bane for doctors !\nBoon : Medicine has become a High income profession !\nBane : Over worked doctors with minimal personal time !",
      "Spot on Dilip Kumar .. Doctors are made to run behind targets and the end result is they are aging faster than the patients",
      "This is the reality for many doctors in India. It's time for the government and healthcare decision-makers to implement real change, from regulating working hours to safeguarding doctors' well-being. Even small changes can create a lasting impact. Doctors are meant to be savers, not silent sufferers.",
      "Maybe using AI, they can reduce their workload and get more time for themselves!!",
      "True",
      "This is a powerful and sobering reminder, Dilip. The toll on doctors’ health and well-being is often overlooked, yet it’s fundamental to the sustainability of healthcare itself. Empathy—both for patients and for those who care for them—is essential as we integrate technology and AI into the system. Thank you for shedding light on this critical issue.",
      "Tech should help us work smarter, not replace the human touch especially in healthcare. Robots might do surgeries, but people still want a real doctor to talk to. Also regarding the Medical association report i am not surprised. I’ve seen it firsthand my cousins are doctors, and they’ve been burnt out since their MBBS journey started. It’s time we focus on making life better for both doctors and patients.",
      "Who knew doctors would need a prescription for self-care? 🤔❤️",
      "Dilip Kumar It's brutal how the system is for doctors. My parents are doctors and I have seen my dad risk his life during Covid while seeing patients, risk his health and meal times so that he can do justice to patients who are in misery and have waited for long. But what irks me sometimes is that those very patients expect fast service, magic treatment and often won't even follow the doctor's prescription. \nThe hours, the work is crazy and then the way hospitals and patients both try to squeeze every inch of the doctor's sanity is appalling.",
      "Surprised and Shocked 🥺 ",
      "Salute to the profession. Huge respect for doctors. \nHowever the story resonates with few  - working as MOs at district hospital, or Dr at a busy trauma/ emergency center. \nA bigger lot does it on their own, to honour all appointment to build up their base. \n\nAlso, the story should be more for the support staff like Nurses and technicians who are in direct control of Doctors and administration and rarely choose such life on their own. \n\nSo the right question is - Who is the decision maker of your condition?",
      "How sad, but not surprising.\nBeing a doctor means you’re an expert in disease not in health ♥️\nTime to switch it up!",
      "This is the exact reason why startups working in preventive and early disease state should be supported, so that the patient footfall reduces in  hospitals, reducing the burden on the entire healthcare ecosystem.",
      "Ahh so sad.\nWhat if somehow they could reduce their everyday documentation burden, get help with monitoring patient data, and live with no  patient files flying all over the IPD\n\nWhat if!?",
      "Palash Trivedi",
      "It’s hard to read this and not feel seen.\nBehind every hour we clock, there’s a silent health cost we stop counting — because the system never counted it in the first place.\n\nThe pitch decks are many. The tools are plenty. But what we need now are builders who’ve lived the burnout.\n\nI believe AI can help. But only if it walks with empathy — not over it.\nThank you for reminding us what really needs saving.\n",
      "Enforcement of strict labour laws. Politicians got some hands in major hospitals",
      "I hope that as we innovate, we prioritize the mental and physical well-being of our medical staff. A healthcare system without empathy for its own saviors won’t stand.",
      "Absolutely spot on Dilip Kumar. Doctors experience high levels of work related stress and burnout, not to mention the psychological impact  on their well being when day in day out they are listening only to problems and offer solutions! \nAnd to do this selflessly, maintaining their composure is the epitome of humanity!",
      "Sometimes its important to acknowledge that Work-life-balance and Fitness Mantras are for everyone including the prescribing Doctor! ",
      "Unfortunately, the capitalist economy often thrives more on manipulation than on empathy, prioritizing profit over people.",
      "Mental and physical health of doctors is so neglected that it is beyond ironic. AI and tech can really help doctor burnout but not by threatening to replace them. It can help by easing the life of healthcare professionals so that they have the time to eat better, move more, take therapy or whatever it is that they would like to do for better health.",
      "Solving for process efficiency and productivity for doctors using AI is important, as much as their well-being. Care-giver fatigue and its consequence is real, so is for doctors too!",
      "Same with medical laboratory sciences",
      "While technology can transform healthcare, neglecting the mental and physical health of our doctors will break the very system they uphold. In Nepal, the crisis is just as real. It's urgent that we act now to protect and support those who save lives every day, putting empathy and care at the heart of all solutions.",
      "That why prevention is better than cure... Life in city environment is very very tough, as they only get wrong & polluted air, water, food & even entertainment (unless one can afford to spend crores & lot of time).. Diseases also spread much more easily in city due to higher density of population and tiny living spaces.. If one live/work in big farms (say 5000-10000sq ft)  in airy field then infection rate will drop significantly.. (say in our Gujarbaria Village,).. Yes one will earn less, but expenses are hardly anything and one will get upto 40 year extra youthful life.. ",
      "Good topic and matter of more research.",
      "Very well said.  Hard truth.                       ",
      "As a health insurance professional, I feel we would expect to see higher claims for stress-related illnesses like cardiovascular diseases, mental health issues, and occupational infections within this demographic. \n\nThe underwriters should, and likely do, view doctors as a higher-risk group due to their lifestyle, stress levels, and exposure.",
      "A healthcare system that neglects the well-being of its healers is fundamentally unsustainable, no matter how advanced its tech.",
      "It's surprising how the Healthcare system deteriorates the health of their own staff. The entire clinical system needs a reform",
      "Dilip Kumar The reduced life expectancy of doctors compared to their patients in India stems from the belief that longer training periods and rigorous filtering alone can ensure the development of quality healthcare providers to address the country’s massive healthcare crisis. However, this approach often worsens the situation by overburdening the system and negatively impacting doctors' quality of life, contributing to their shorter lifespans. Constantly requiring doctors to clear multiple competency exams does little to improve care and, in the worst-case scenario, adds strain to an already overstretched healthcare system. To address this, India must reform its medical education by promoting collaborative and shared care delivery across various levels, and by recognizing that extending doctors' life expectancy by even a decade would have a more meaningful impact than simply increasing the number of medical seats, only to force new doctors into an already broken system.",
      "Dilip Kumar, that's a good discussion you started. Good to read the comments mentioned below too. I get that the central message here isn't anti-AI. On reading it, like you, my first response was a call for empathy - for recognizing that doctors are not just care providers, they are also humans dealing with immense emotional and physical stress. Technology is often pitched as a replacement, not an assistant. A tech ecosystem that enhances, not undermines, their work is missing in the system. A broken system that doesn’t protect its caretakers cannot sustain itself. ",
      "wow, seems to be a burnout epidemic in Indian healthcare. thaks for higlighting this Dilip Kumar.",
      "Before we fix systems with tech, we must care for the humans who keep them running—starting with our doctors. Dilip Kumar",
      "One part is external—a shortage of doctors. Too few shoulders to carry the weight of too many patients. This creates long hours, relentless demand, and exhaustion. The system simply doesn’t have enough hands.\n\nBut the other part is internal—a pressure that doctors place on themselves. The pursuit of commercial success, prestige, and growth has turned many into entrepreneurs in white coats. The anxiety that comes from this chase isn’t imposed—it’s self-generated, like any businessperson who ties their worth to their results.",
      "When the saving hands of the gods vanish swiftly, it is a clear sign that we are in deep trouble.🙄",
      "Hospital administrations are taken over by nonmedicos and corporate hospitals are run by business men.. Doctors can't do much when healthcare becomes a profit making machine... If Government hospitals could have handled patients well with necessary infrastructure and personnel, then doctors will be able to focus on clinical care and research.",
      "Yes. Empathy for doctors is really important for healthcare's future.\n\nDilip Kumar",
      "Integrating AI could reduce some workload, allowing doctors more time for self-care and mental health support Dilip Kumar",
      "The core of any human connection is to empathise. To feel each others struggle and give enough space for other person.\nFor the medical practitioners, it is really a sad scenario. They have to bear the brunt of the emotional stress of the relatives attending their dear ones.",
      "we are looking at one set of issues ,hospital waste which is one of the many  source of infections and needs to be destroyed ..this affects the health of all health workers not just Doctors ..my Australian collegues / cofounders have a device that does this and is being tested ... Health workers face massive risk starting from Doctors / Nurses and they are underpaid ..Totally agree with your views ....",
      "Dilip Kumar unhealthy lifestyle including lack of physical activity, poor diet and stress is widely prevalent in India. And these are the top 3 reasons for high mortality. Doctors have all the information and the money to buy technology or AI. But the issue is much deeper and cultural. For example, 30 minute simple excercise should be integral part of your day. But not many parents teach the importance of exercise, which carries on with them. Also, there are no good facilities for excercise or even walking/running  spaces in the cities, forget about running on the streets, you can be run over by a car or chased by dogs. \n\nSo huge part of India’s health problems are poor infrastructure and cultural problems, not technology problems. \n\n(Well I am frustrated because whenever I come here I cannot find a good place to run and none of my doctors friends wants to run😊)",
      "Isn't the narrative quite familier? Farmers who feed us also go through the same distress because they are also told that they should be feeding the society before they could feed themselves. Are we innovating enough to solve their problems?",
      "Very unfortunately true :( It’s a matter of time we lose doctors with immense experience and commitment (that came at a personal cost) and land in a heightened demand-good supply issue like in the west, waiting for weeks and even months for an appointment even for critical diseases.",
      "True",
      "Choose the job which AI cannot replace like patient care ....",
      "This is powerful and painfully true. While we chase efficiency through tech and AI, we often forget the human beings holding up the system. Empathy shouldn’t be optional, especially in healthcare.At Mochsha.in , we're building something in a very different space (live music), but the principle holds: systems work best when we don't ignore the people behind them.",
      "Thanks for sharing this interesting and informative article Dilip. It names a number of probable causes. One is hoping that the medical community will dig deeper and generate data to identify the major groups causing it so that they can be addressed. It may also be useful to study the impact of \"over usage\" of drugs to address issues that may be better addressed by lifestyle changes ?  In fact AI may be able to help collate common these data points ? ",
      "Most of the doctors can't take care of their own nutritional needs sadly :/\n\nCoached a doctor on nutrition and exercise lately!",
      "I hope AI could alleviate stress causing factors and make the life of doctors easier and better than it is now.",
      "Dilip Kumar This is a powerful and essential post. The human cost to our doctors is undeniably high.\nJust as OceanTree Oceanlux CCU (Prop + Climate-tech) Architecture aims for indoor environmental optimization, we desperately need to apply that same focus to the immediate spaces of our healthcare professionals. Imagine the impact of literal and figurative \"oxygen infusion indoors\" – creating healthier, less stressful environments where doctors can truly breathe and thrive. We must design systems that sustain them, not exhaust them.",
      "Thank you for this!",
      "60-80 hours of clinical work plus 20-30 hours of on-call service to their regular patients and counseling to family, relatives and friends. The crisis you have discussed here is real.",
      "Doctors have a brutal regime...\n\nGetting in, with the Neet exam, is where the mental pressure begins - in 8th or 9th graders. Lakhs of kids competing for a few thousand seats, at an age when they have no emotional maturity,  just really big dreams...\n\nAnd it gets progressively more difficult.  Sleep, exercise are illusions, there are times when u live on parle G and tea... or worse, cigarettes...\n\nLife gets no easier, ever. \n\nIts probably the most brutal career to train for, with very little systemic support and extremely delayed rewards...",
      "Very true",
      "No one thinks in India that Doctors Do anything. Even though average life expectancy has doubled from 1947 to date!",
      "According to me, creating a sustainable healthcare environment requires a holistic approach that includes mental health support, manageable workloads, and a culture that values the well-being of healthcare providers. Only then can we truly improve the healthcare system for everyone involved. ",
      "This hit hard. We often forget the healers need healing too. The irony of saving lives while slowly losing your own to the system is heartbreaking. AI can assist—but it can’t replace rest, respect, and empathy.",
      "Equating doctors and/or hospitals with Health or healthcare is a gross misunderstanding of that industry . At best they are a sickness care provider. Also most doctors are emergency service specialist. The entire medical curriculum is designed to treat illness or handle emergency/Trauma/Surgeries. We shouldn't be looking up to them as as HEALTH role models. They cant be because they are not taught to make people healthy but treat ailments and address emergencies. We need a different \"Health\" only ecosystem which will take away burden from the existing \"Sick care\" ecosystem so that the doctors/hospitals can focus what they are trained to do , Address emergencies, do life saving surgeries, Attend to Trauma cases etc. \n\nWe don't need to correct the existing model, its is good for what it is created for. We need to create alternate model of healthcare where doctors are no longer role models but as human as rest of us.",
      "This highlights a critical issue often overlooked: the health and wellbeing of those who care for others.",
      "It is generally 6-7 years that the doctor sees his first salary. The moment they pursue PG, they start getting a salary.",
      "This hit hard.\n\nWe talk about burnout like it’s a phase.\nFor most doctors, it’s a life sentence masked as duty.\n\nThe irony?\n\nThe very people trained to keep us alive are being broken by the system that trained them.\n\nAnd now they’re being told a tool might do it “more efficiently.”",
      "I’ve seen firsthand how daunting it is for doctors to care for their patients as well as tackle all the paperwork and other formalities that are thrust upon them. There should be a better way for them to juggle this work and have an acceptable social/family life without compromising on either.",
      "A sobering reality—if only we could automate empathy as easily as diagnostics. Until then, perhaps we should invest as much in the well-being of doctors as we do in tech promising to “fix” the system.",
      "Charan Kamal Health Group  \nDr. Tanmeet Oberoi (PT)",
      "70 percent of Doctors in India are unhealthy.",
      "They are trained for illness not for wellness.",
      "The doctor who treated my dad for cancer passed away from kidney failure during the course of his care. He gave everything—until there was nothing left to give.\n\nOur doctors deserve better.",
      "Dilip Kumar, you’re right. India’s doctors aren’t just dying early—they’re being systemically failed. But history shows us that even the most entrenched crises can be reversed with political will and collective action. Here’s how we can turn this around:\n\nGlobal playbook India must adopt now:\nWork-Hour Reform\n US caps at 80 hrs/week, EU at 48 hrs/week. India? 100+ hours with no regulation.\n  Fix: Amend the Factories Act to include healthcare.\nMental Health Support\n US/UK offer confidential, anonymous therapy. \nIndia? Stigma + no access.\n  Fix: 1 counsellor per 100 beds via state schemes.\nViolence Protection\n Australia has panic buttons, & Canada runs “Code White.”\n India? Silence.\n  Fix: Enforce “Code Silver” + fast-track courts.\nAdmin Relief\n Scandinavia uses AI; Germany mandates scribes.\n India? 30% of doctors' time is lost to paperwork.\n Fix: Subsidise AI scribes under Ayushman Bharat.\nTraining Reform\n The US & the Netherlands teach emotional resilience. India? Rote learning.\n  Fix: Upgrade AETCOM with mandatory wellness modules.\nWellness Incentives\n The US pays stipends, & France adds 20% pay for stress roles.\n India? No incentive.\n  Fix: Link pay to burnout zones + wellness metrics.\nThis isn’t charity; it’s economic survival.",
      "Having observed this personally, I believe they need support and understanding to manage their own health and well-being, alongside their commitment to patient care.",
      "Add to that the public humiliation faced (see the Vishwajit Rane Incident in Goa) and vandalism when things go downhill for patients who cant be saved. Most doctors think its their call of duty to work long hours, on weekends, to answer whatsapp messages from patients etc.  Health system needs empathy and also people who are patient to work with it, not flybynight operators",
      "Medicine study teaches how to treat disease and not how to prevent it. Doctors spend years studying illness but almost no time learning nutrition, movement, sleep, breath in the curriculum. The burnout they face is a design flaw. I have encouraged many docs in my circle to read atleast a few books on health n nutrition.",
      "Dilip Kumar , we did a digital (non invasive) heart health expedition program for doctors, nurses and medical and non medical staff in a series of teaching medical colleges and its hospitals and the results clearly surpassed the prevalence rates of - Diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, OSA. It also showed high cardiac burden; low heart energy potential and less and depleted heart efficiency, early sub clinical predictors for atherosclerosis. So far we have seen the evidence that the 20’s is the new 40’s and surprisingly 40’s are better aware than 20’s.",
      "How does one get to talk to you Dilip Kumar?",
      "This is shocking!",
      "Thanks for your concern.  I can site a few remedies for this .\n1. Stop having impractical expectations from the treatment . Social media false claims and faux advertisements  by private hospitals add fuel to this expectations. \n2. Do not try to treat your doctor as God,  he has no magic power . He is like other professionals who helps you when you are in trouble.\n3. Trust your doctor fully ,but if you have slightest of doubt move on. A doctor has a peaceful mind  when he finds that the patient trusts him fully.\n4. Do not judge a doctor by the sheer number of Google reviews or presence of patients in the waiting area. You can buy those.\nThere is a difference between a good doctor and a famous doctor that you will have to judge.\n5. Take active part in the decision making by your doctor.\n6.All these will help the doctor to go for defensive medicine at your own cost.\n\nFor the doctors  - To some of us it appears that there is no tomorrow. We forget that the doctors are responsible for their families and more importantly their own health.\nPeer pressure to own an expensive flat or a car or face book publications for exotic holiday pics doesn't yield patients. It is the time given to them  with a  little honesty that matter most.",
      "Greater participation of doctors & nurses in the making of healthcare AI, so that realistic pain points concerning Drs & nurses who are at 'ground zero' & actually take the hits are actively worked upon & resolved...not just AI designs made soley in Offices !!",
      "Newer crop of doctors are well aware of this. They either leave the country or leave medical practice earlier. Yeah a few cant afford either would die earlier probably than their patients.",
      "Also, the pay is peanuts for the first 5-10 years after the first 10 years of intense education.",

      "Thank you for calling this out, Dilip!",
      "Most surgeons I know are also smokers, the high stress, odd working hours only adding to the outcome. Empathise is the least we can do, after them working tirelessly for hours at times. ",
      "This one is an eye opener Dilip.\n\nI would go to a skilled doctor using AI, than the hospitals that are completely running on AI.\nBecause it's the empathy and the human touch that makes traversing critical health conditions better. Not just precise tech solutions.\n\nAnd I have personally seen my doctor friends leave everything and tirelessly work for days without break. And wonder how can a system be built to ensure they focus on their health too—A problem statement that actually needs tech or system intervention, in my opinion.",
      "Doctors need healing too.",
      "AI won't make doctors obsolete anytime soon; if anything, doctors will now have one more task of navigating around AI learned patients. \nFirst the softwares that added clicks but did little to improve patient care, and now AI, that will very confidently misguide the patients with a disclaimer shrugging off the responsibility. \nThis piece is a reality check for those building patient facing LLM powered tools: https://amirkiani.xyz/posts/yari-care-nav/",
      "Dilip Kumar Absolutely, the medical fraternity puts so much of time and effort into working towards people’s better health. \nAn important point, It boils down to supply and demand Biomedicine unlike the Tech space needs a long time in training. No other domain grew in so much of understanding over the last few decades as Biomedical Sciences.  So there is a huge shortage in the number of people who get trained. An other extremely ignored domain in biomedical Scientists and researchers who contributed to the development. They equally toil for 12-15hrs a day with very poor outcomes, as they are mostly invisible to society.  \nThis is nothing to do with lacking empathy for clinicians. The point to raise the thought of the entire community who contribute to betterment of health!",

      "If you think its because of #people or politics or inaccurate tools to judge a problem or time taking clinical reports?\n\nWe are helping Doctors to generate medical reports from Xrays in matter of seconds, there by creating Gold Standards of accuracy in detecting disease  and that too immediately. Thereby no wastage of time and early detection reduce the chance of delay in writing prescriptions.\n\nInterested to know how it's changing the landscaping of rural upliftment? ",
      "This may be anecdotal, but I've found most doctors ignore their own advice, a lot of them smoke and drink, and I suspect they may feel disassociated and apathetic about their own future disease if they see disease and death every day. ",
      "We need more Doctors.\nWe also need AI to help them reduce their Stress and working hours.\n\nBoth are true at the same time...",
      "Doctors are stressed specially in the public health facilities and tech can definitely offload the pressure.

      "Mental Health of doctors is also generally very poor, often overburdened but also greatly isolated. Unlike other professions say Bankers who work with each other, Doctors particularly running their own clinics barely interact with their own colleagues/classmates/friends leading to further isolation.\n\nWe had a family doctor uncle (my parents' friend) from Sir Sundar Lal - Lucknow, undoubtedly a high achieving genius with extreme detail to attention, who saw our entire family for some 35 odd years; who died couple years ago at age 63. Towards last decade of his life, he has become increasingly lonely, isolated, separated from his wife, chain smoker, and drowned himself in work and books - yet lonely amid the crowd of nurses, compounders and patients. \n\nSigns of this loneliness and isolation and lack of friends/community around doctors can be seen in mid 40s, as soon as they get more senior and move out from Hospital job system to their own clinic system. \n\nSometimes, I deduce, friends and community is the highest life extending agent, ahead of nutrition, exercise and everything else.

      "Felt this deeply.\nNo YouTube video or blog can prep you for the real grind. It’s lonely, exhausting, and at times, just plain confusing.\nThat line — “there’s no pivot for your body” — really stayed with me.\nHealth, people, purpose. Easy to overlook, but so important.\nGrateful you shared this.",
      "Keep moving - one step at a time!",
      "Excellent words. Your health is hardest hit when you build something passionately.",
      "Always on point, Dilip Kumar, thank you!!  ",
      "Founding from force is different than founding from alignment.\nThe first burns fast. The second sustains.\n\nWe talk about MVPs, market fit, traction, rarely about the inner systems:\n 🧠 How to separate your worth from your revenue\n 💬 How to stay curious when feedback stings\n 💛 How to build without betraying yourself",
      "This is the kind of honest advice more aspiring founders need to hear—especially the part about health and relationships. Hustle culture glorifies burnout, but what’s the point of building an empire if your body’s broken and you’re alone at the top? Bookmarking this for every time I need to realign with what actually matters",
      "Love this, Dilip",
      "Powerful and real advice, Dilip! 🙌 The startup journey is definitely not glamorous — it’s tough, unpredictable, and often lonely. Prioritizing health and relationships alongside hustle is what truly sustains long-term success.",
      "This needs to be printed, framed, and slapped on every founder’s wall.",
      " Prioritizing health and relationships isn’t just self-care; it’s foundational for sustainable success. ",
      "Thanks Dilip Kumar . Amazing advice.",
      "This hit hard. As a founder, it’s easy to lose perspective when stakes are high. But this reminder about detaching ego from outcome is gold—humility is what keeps long-term builders in the game.",
      "Excellent advice 👏.. i guess every entrepreneur resonates to each world of this..",
      "This truly resonates with me as someone navigating my own path. The romanticized versions of entrepreneurship rarely show the grit, loneliness, and relentless challenges behind the scenes. Taking care of our mental and physical health isn’t just self-care—it’s survival for the long haul. And the reminder about relationships hits home: success feels empty without people to share it with. Authenticity and love for the work are indeed the only true compass through the uncertainty. Grateful for this —it’s the kind of wisdom every aspiring founder needs to hear.",
      "Dilip Kumar, thanks for writing this. In a world where hustle culture is celebrated, people need to hear this.",
      "Chasing status burns out more builders than failure does. Staying rooted in purpose is impactful Dilip Kumar",
      "Love this, Dilip. Definitely something to carry with us daily 👍 ",
      "Wise words. Nothing matters more than health and if you're building something today, build with the mindset and awareness to create something that adds joy to what you already have, not deplete it.   ",
      "You're so right about taking care of health—I've been guilty of neglecting it, and it really does catch up with you. Thanks for the reminder to prioritize it Dilip Kumar",
      "I think doing good and proving your worth is OK but not at the cost of physical and mental health.\n\nDilip Kumar",
      "Excellent advice! Building from authenticity - intrinsic motivation - is good for your health, and good for the people who experience your output. \n\nUse journaling/coaching/inner work to catch the places where you’re chasing validation and approval, we all do it 😂 but the best creations have a pure intention, as well as viability",
      "I firmly believe - value the basics. Family, good health, purpose. Everything else falls in place",
      "Build from clarity, not chaos. From craft, not status. From love, not FOMO. This is the most honest advice I’ve read in a while.",
      "Dilip Kumar Every line here hits hard. Building something real takes more than vision, it takes resilience, humility, and heart.",
      "One of the things I've realised over the years as an entrepreneur is that most people (almost 99%) underestimate the amount of work it takes to achieve sustainability and profitability. And this same set of people highly overestimate the quality of life.",
      "We’re all finally on our own journies.",
      "The raw truth here speaks so high! Thank you for sharing this. ",
      "Entrepreneurship requires resilience, patience, a strong nervous system, and serious work ethic.\n It’s not for the average person — and that’s okay.",
      "If I had a coin for every time someone asked me whether they should quit their 9–5 and become an entrepreneur, and I said “no,” I’d be a billionaire by now.",
      "Dear aspiring founders, ask a simple question to yourself, why do you want to start-up. Your answer will decide your perseverance, passion and patience in this journey. \nIf you are starting up to solve your own problems, you may have a difficult time. If you are solving the problems of others, the struggle is worthwhile.",
      "Powerful advice. Entrepreneurship is a tough, winding road. Prioritize health, relationships, and authenticity to navigate the journey with clarity and joy.",
      "One more time for the people in the back on their 5th cup of coffee and haven’t seen the sky in days 😂😂\n\nNo but seriously this is one thing startups and VCs don’t talk about enough. The PERSON behind the success. The human that needs to carry the team and show up every day even when things hit the fan. \n\nFounders, you are the most expensive and important investment!!! \n\nTreat yourself like it",
      "Needed to hear this. Thanks Dilip",
      "Great advice—founding a startup is more “choose your own adventure” than highlight reel. The wellness tips are spot on; there are no shortcuts when it comes to health or relationships, no matter how magical your pitch deck is.",
      "Thanks for the reminder. :)",
      "So well said.",
      "So authentic Dilip Kumar",
      "Love this, Dilip Kumar, especially this line \" You’re not wealthy if you have no one to share it with.\" It hit home when I thought how rich I would be if I had no family commitments  then I felt what's the joy of parking your Lamborghini and entering the empty house 🙃 ",
      "This is some real sage advice. Fully agree 💯",
      "This is the least spoken or documented part of entrepreneurship! It is tough, indeed :)",
      "Sharing something like this honest, helps. Thanks.",
      "We humans tend to take things for granted which are easily available to us via luck..",
      "Wowww! Thanks for sharing this. Just started my entrepreneurial journey and perspectives like this help a lot.",
      "It is so true, Dilip Kumar",
      "We don't speak enough about how building something can quietly cost you everything else.\n\nThe silent tax of ambition, unless you are paying attention.",
      "This is divine, needed to hear this today . Thanks",
      "It's supposed to be hard. If it were easy, everyone would do it. But it does not have to be lonely. ",
      "\nGood note! I had seen two of my ex-bosses at close quarters really gut it out as founders, so I had a fair idea of what I was getting into. And yet when I started and even now, I know that I underestimated how hard and complex this was going to be. 🙃 ",
      "So so true! Your posts are very inspiring Dilip !\nMore power to you 🙌🏻",
      "The authenticity in your posts 🙏. Thank you for creating this.",
      "Very wise words Dilip; really resonates.",

      "As real as it can be Dilip Kumar always encouraging and inspiring to read what you post. In the world of reels have something for real. Thanks for sharing this",
      "We often glorify the outcome but forget that the process comes with invisible costs.",
      "Hit a spot.\nEspecially since i have done this grind over a long period of time.\n\nRelationships need to be compounded well & slow. Create a bedrock. Important.\n\nAnother important aspect it to be astute & quick learner.\n\nDon’t take failure personally!",
      "Beautifully said Dilip.  Good Sunday morning reminder.\n",
      "🤐",
      "Balance is key 👍",
      "Beautifully said",
      "Exactly",
      "Raw, real, and necessary. This is the kind of advice every aspiring founder needs to hear before chasing the highlight reel.\n",
      "Truly Dilip, your authenticity is your superpower. 🙌\nThanks for always showing up with such quiet strength and support. \"Build from love\" — that line will stay with me.",
      "Barath Akkihebbal",
      "Dilip Sunday morning and this important post highlighting holistic approach to entrepreneurship - acknowledging the journey isn’t as glorious as it is portrayed; health is vital, relationships need to be taken care of and building from a place of authenticity!\n\nThis last point is 🔥\n\nAt EA, we too are acknowledging and inspiring for building from a place of authenticity and love for the craft.\n\nUnderstanding one’s own unique lane is first step, next is walking it. Almost 80% of the founders we interact with inquire because they’re finally tired, frustrated and fed up of fighting the competition and realise the importance of thinking and building monopoly.",
      "Love this ! Your advice is pure gold - Especially the one on watching videos . My greatest learning is there is no shortcut - and best lessons come through constant experimentation and failure .",
      "Well advised . Thanks Dilip.",

It’s because we are not just investors, we’re here to build ecosystems. And India needs that now. \n\nMost VCs love to talk about their portfolio.

We’ve never played the status game. We support founders and even their competitors, if it helps grow the category and the narrative.

      "This is the kind of VC mindset India desperately needs—less gatekeeping, more category building. \nFounders are rewriting the rules, and it's time investors did too. \nBacking the ecosystem, not just equity, is what creates real, lasting change. \nPlaying the long game isn’t old-school—it’s visionary",
      "The problem with 2000 funds is that it is too much money chasing too few venture fundable deals. Startups that should not be funded are getting funded. Extreme pressure is being put on them to grow at venture scale. And then, between 2023 and 2024, 28,000 startups have shut down. If they bootstrapped, focused on steady customer development and providing real value, iterated through the inevitable market challenges, there would not be so many deaths.\n\nToo many startups that should be bootstrapped are raising VC money.",
      "Emergence of new age fund that offers much more that just capital is what the founders will look for in future. It  will be first individual movement then institution will follow on.",
      "Your perspective on fostering a collaborative ecosystem in India is truly inspiring, Dilip. Supporting founders across the board and focusing on category growth rather than just portfolio bragging is a refreshing approach that will undoubtedly lead to richer innovation. Keep championing this mindset!",
      "BUSINESS CLASS FOR EVERYONE\nHi Dilip,\nI’m building— a new Indian airline that’s going 100% business class at near-economy fares., \n\nWe’re not tweaking the system — we’re replacing it.\nImagine Indigo meets Emirates — flat beds, gourmet meals, premium experience — but built for the Indian mass flyer, not just the 1%.\none mission:\nMake business class the new economy.\nI know you’ve seen bold ideas before. But I don’t think you’ve seen this one.\nWould love 5 minutes to show you why this isn’t just another startup — it’s the next transport revolution out of India.\nRegards,\nAnsh Thakral\nhttps://www.trasil.in/",
      "it is with the same concern about VC funding that build3 came into being... we all could benefit from letting go of traditional VC models. ",
      "We need 2-3 YC's in India alone Dilip Kumar",
      "How can you support a seed level company which wants to give ICAI standard accounting software for Rupees 500 per year it has ERP .",
      "Dilip Kumar Love the idea of flipping the script—founders asking VCs what *they're* bringing to the table. Feels like that kind of transparency could push the whole ecosystem forward. Imagine if more funds shared openly like this...it’d shift how categories grow.",
      "Completely agree, investors need to think beyond innovation as every start can't be  innovative especially building market segments, one player cannot serve the whole purpose, multiple players in the same space will benefit customers & startups also work more cautiously.",
      "Focusing on building categories, not just portfolios, is what creates lasting change—especially in a market as diverse and dynamic as India. ",
      "How do you make a parrot talk differently when it has to earn its bonuses, Dilip. Even if someone makes toilet paper VCs will ask - what are you disrupting and what’s your IP and how can you scale 100X in two seasons. Delusion is a real thing in today’s world.",
      "Ecosystem-first mindset over ego—India needs category creators, not gatekeepers.",
      "Love how you focus on growing the whole category, not just chasing winners. That kind of long-term thinking is rare and so needed in India right now. Real change happens when the ecosystem rises together.",
      "Dilip Kumar Most won't. \n\nI have been witnessing this from almost a decade. \n\nWith borrowed money comes borrowed mindset and temptation to imitate. \n\nSame set of 100 questions. Same terminology. Same cute-little-powerplays, Same podcasts, Same theories. Same phoney accent. \n\nMost will die in the ocean of sameness. \n\nIf there is one industry that needs to be disrupted it's venture capital. \n\nWhat's the point playing the game of using other people's money on other - like a glorified middleman, when it's not about impact and disruption. \n\nI feel.

      "The Agritech category desperately needs a system like this which can build an ecosystem where builders can collaborate and grow together while being in a portfolio of an investor to grow the entire category. This unfortunately hasn't been happening where startups are hesitant and so are the investors. Good to see the Rainmatter by Zerodha  initiative in this area.",
      "Well said Dilip!",
      "Dilip Kumar, true impact isn’t about owning every deal—it’s about growing the whole category. Like how a rising tide lifts all boats, supporting competitors can expand the market and create new opportunities for everyone. India’s startup ecosystem needs that mindset shift—more builders, more breakthroughs, less gatekeeping.\nThe future belongs to those who build ecosystems, not just portfolios.",
      "It helps to have LPs who align with what you are doing :)) not everyone with similar cash, have similar thoughts, really nice to see what you guys are doing Dilip Kumar",
      "Consistently precise, as always.",
      "VCs should ask themselves: \nWhat’s new in our fund? \nBuilding ecosystems is as important as funding unicorns.",
      "I've seen in Indian VC market, most folks look for industry experience, like how many years the founder has been in the industry, what he di,d and more, but as we've seen, most successful company founders have different perspective to see the new indsty and they hold the power of distption. In the Valley, they promote bold ideas and founders. Hopefully, Indian VCs will also create a newer version or model to support young founders with a not-so-industry-led thesis.   ",
      "Dilip, philosophically what you say makes sense. Practically, not as much. I'll tell you why. \n\nIf I am building something truly disruptive (which I am... you know about Mindei), 1) I know it's going to be a big burner right up front, and 2) the risks, incl. but not limited to financial risks are significantly high. \n\nOn top of this, my limited experience tells me Indian VC ecosystem is still not ready to invest in true disruptive, early-stage startups from first-time founders. America is yet to fully export the culture of taking risky bets with patient capital to India. \n\nAs founder therefore, I am playing a high-stakes game with the pool of possibly interested VCs being really small. \n\nAnd then if I make them go through the kind of grind you mention ... I might reduce the pool even further. \n\nIt's a buyers' market (the buyer being the VC). \n\nSo whilst I try to get the investor-founder fitment right (which is why we've been talking :)) -- I don't try to make a big deal about it. Because one has to consider all aspects, and the sustainability of the venture above all, in making key decisions such as this. \n\nOn a separate note, is there an application form for being invited to the podcast? :)  ",
      "Well said Dilip. Can we talk? \nHint: blue ocean opportunity + Indian market + Healthcare segment",
      "While fundraising often centers around the financial ask, founders should also consider the non-monetary value a VC can bring to the table. May be they can seek below as well apart from financial ask\n\t•\tAccess to networks that open doors to customers, talent, and partners.\n\t•\tExpertise in marketing, branding, and tech to strengthen your core.\n\t•\tFounder communities, even for those not funded, to learn from peers across sectors.",
      "How does Rainmatter manage potential conflicts of interest or IP sharing concerns when supporting multiple players in the same category? This seems to be a hurdle for such a model.",
      "I an Entrepreneur and Founder looking for good platform to share my journey and experience. Hard find find good platform for Guinune People.",
      "Imagine there's no heaven\nIt's easy if you try\nNo hell below us\nAbove us, only sky\nImagine all the people\nLivin' for today\nAh....\n\nLet's all dream & imagine as thats what is the base root of change. Us, the black sheep.... The outcasts are the ones that bring the change. ",
      "Love this post Dilip; couldn’t agree more. The game has changed, and it’s refreshing to see a mindset that’s focused on building for today’s time, not clinging to playbooks from the past. Building strong ecosystems and growing categories is what really matters now.",
      "Dilip Kumar how to be part of the podcast",
      "I believe encouraging open dialogues between founders and VCs can lead to more innovative solutions. It's refreshing to see Rainmatter's commitment to elevating the whole industry, not just individual players. Let's keep pushing for that change together.",
      "VCs shaping the ecosystem beyond just their portfolio is exactly what India’s startup scene needs. Supporting category growth over individual status creates a ripple effect that benefits all players.",
      "Love this mindset, your ecosystem-first thinking is what truly drives a  long-term change. More power to funds like yours that prioritise categories over competition 👏",
      "Much of this also applies outside the venture world.\nIn SMBs, too many deals are decided by signaling: who sold, who bought, who else is in.\nBut running real companies with real margins, real customers, and real problems rarely aligns with that game.\n\nMore capital should ask: Are we building sustainable categories or just collecting logos?\n"

      "Great point Dilip Kumar. Thanks for sharing. \n\nMost people still overlook the importance of holistic eating—choosing convenience and price over clean, organic food. What we eat literally becomes us, yet toxic chemicals continue to find a way into our diets.\n\nToday, less than 1% of urban India consumes organic food.\n\nThat’s where Organik Truck steps in—making wholesome, organic food more affordable and accessible in Mumbai.

India has almost none of those ingredients in the same proportion yet.\n\nIndian founders are world class at surviving, hacking & stretching resources. But YC worked because it taught founders to focus on scaling instead of surviving.\nIndian early stage capital still acts like it's lending money , not taking risk.

      "In one of the interviews  Mr Sabeer Bhatia (hotmail founder) said that most VCs in India are people operating with a PE mindset in the name of VCs. \nApart from the incubators and accelerators, the funding ecosystem available ahead also decides the confidence and structure of early stage company's DNA. \nWell put Dilip Kumar  the interlink between both the ecosystems in India currently.",
      "True \nStartups need more than just Capital... Ecosystem, Experience, (Investor's skin in the game)...\nWe can't compete we YC but need a Indian version of it",
      "India needs its own model, absolutely.\n\nWe may not be well served by models that de-emphasize hiring, or emphasize growth at any cost.\n\nWhat we need are models that result in sustainable employment generation, sustainable growth.\n\nThe reason the IT services industry has worked so well, is because of this. But obviously there are issues with that model - it was perfect for a previous generation. We have to build a better model for today - higher up the value chain, delivering better results per employee.",
      "Insightful, thank you Dilip",
      "This really resonates. I was recently discussing with my co-founder (based in the US) how differently things function at a systems level — the way structure, risk, and innovation are approached is fundamentally different from what we see here.\n\nIn our conversations with VCs here, we’ve observed that there can be some hesitation around newer, less familiar technologies. This cautious approach, while understandable, can sometimes become a bottleneck for early-stage startups working on disruptive or deep-tech ideas that need early belief to grow.\n\nIt would be great to see more founder-first micro VCs who truly resonate with the risk-return-impact mindset.\n\nReally inspiring to see you holding this vision, Dilip. That kind of aligned mindset is what fuels real innovation - not \"destructive\" interference, but \"resonating\" belief.",
      "In my experience working with Indian founders, I’ve seen an incredible bias for hustle and survival. But we need an ecosystem that encourages velocity, not just frugality.",
      "Great stuff !! I agree..",
      "Thought provoking and hit the Bulls eyes.",
      "Problem statement is clear. Let's see anyone can do something on this.",
      "I agree with everything you said, but I think we need to look beyond just the lack of a strong narrative. Saying India's main problem is storytelling or marketing feels like we're missing the real issue — which is focus.\n\nA lot of the well-known “dropout founders” from Harvard or Stanford got into those colleges just to drop out and use the brand name to raise money. Their businesses often aim for quick profits by serving mass markets — not real innovation. In India, we’ve copied the outer layer of that model — the hype, fast growth, and name-dropping — but without the systems or culture to support it.\n\nMany of India’s biggest startups aren't led by founders trying to solve real problems. They're more focused on PR and attention than on building long-term solutions. That’s why we got 10-minute grocery delivery before we fixed Bengaluru’s traffic, Delhi’s air pollution, or the lack of affordable housing in crowded cities.\n\nMaybe we don’t need a YC-style program in India. Maybe what we need is something slower, more thoughtful, and truly built for the challenges we face here.",
      "Great perspective",
      "Could not agree more! No need to build in India just because it exists in the West. Let us first build trust, integrity and governance and another venture that will exist for a few months or years and leave investors and consumers in the dust. ",
      "Sorry for Hijacking the comment for something that I am conceptualising along the lines. I am prototyping a framework for early stage build which includes founder personality and interests along build methodology, toolkits and case studies. If anyone else is working on the same, let's connect?",
      "One thing to add is that India is a fast-growing economy, but also one that’s had the benefit (and burden) of watching mature markets evolve before us. In many ways, we’re standing on the shoulders of ecosystems that took the bold risks, so we don’t always need to reinvent the wheel or absorb the same hits.\n\nAnd while it’s true that we might never have a YC-style moment, it doesn’t mean we can’t create something uniquely Indian. The few risk-takers we do have might be small in number, but they’ll define the narrative shift with the right kind of capital and storytelling.",
      "Totally agree that YC was a product of a unique cocktail—time, place, culture—and blindly replicating it here may miss the point. But maybe the problem is exactly that: we keep trying to copy-paste playbooks from other economies without adapting them to our context. India needs its own blueprint.\n\nThat said, I still admire those taking inspiration from YC to build founder-first ecosystems here. The intent matters. Because the gap between the rising number of aspiring entrepreneurs and the kind of real, thoughtful support available is still very real. We need systems that understand Indian founders—not just fund them.",
      "Dilip Kumar, as someone who's been a huge fan of YC, binge-watching demo days, studying their essays, quoting Paul Graham like gospel I’ve always felt this quiet discomfort whenever people said, “Let’s just recreate YC here.”\nIt always felt... incomplete. Like copying the shape of something without understanding the soil it grew from.\nSilicon Valley in the mid-2000s was a wild experiment of cheap failure and expensive dreams.\nIndia, for better or worse, was (and still is) a country where failure costs real social capital, not just dollars.",

      "India VC fund only those ideas that have been copied from west if you create something specific to indian population need ... they never consider that",
      "I think both media & VCs will also need to build conviction on how we can build global consumer companies out of India. While we continue to invest & shine the spotlight on great global SaaS companies coming out of India, we will need greater risk appetite to build truly global consumer companies out of India.\n\nNonetheless, we’re trying to build the best platform to introduce screens & internet to young kids around the world at Kidzovo.",
      "Will build this soon enough Dilip Kumar... thanks for the nudge. Having been through enough of these flaky IC meetings, where exactly the same mentality of loaning money exists... I've decided to build and help others build...very soon, hopefully. But thanks for keeping the fire burning and reminding us all that the need is urgent and real...",
      "YC thrived in a culture that celebrated failure and rewarded the ambition to scale. In India, we need to build an ecosystem that acknowledges the value of risk and lets founders fail without feeling like they’ve lost everything. Maybe that’s the true barrier to creating a YC-like model here.",
      "india doesn’t need a YC clone.\nit needs a system that rewards velocity, not vanity.\nand backers who bet like founders — not gatekeepers with term sheets.",
      "i will say many things can be learned from their model... entirely separate question will or will not model will work..",

      "Cultural DNA different hai , sir ji...you can't make apples wear banana skins 😊",
      "Someone who gave me my 1st lessons in modern age startup gyan told me that in India VC is not venture capitalist but is vulture capitalist. Had our 1st hand experience with few which made us walk the tight rope without the funding support. \nAND we are happy. \n\nIndia is still a long way to get maturity in startup/ entrepreneurship space",
      "YC worked because it was built on a unique set of cultural and economic conditions, and trying to replicate that here might miss the point. The real opportunity for India is in fostering homegrown, founder-first VCs who can truly support risk-taking and scaling. Looking forward to seeing how the Indian ecosystem evolves in its own way!",
      "I think it's apple and oranges comparison, SV is a mature environment with  successful entrepreneurs who have either joined VC firms or have started one. Also ease of business, unlike India, govt is non existent. The undergraduate and masters programs encourage innovation, therefore the comparison will reflect a stark difference. I had in one of my comments in similar context posted about how ebays website was non functional during the first Presentation but still got funded by the same VC. When i asked this question to well know VC in India, they said honestly in India this will never be acceptable. The mindset is not yet there, i guess, but hopefully sooner than later we will get there.",
      "India’s ecosystem is unique its challenges demand homegrown solutions, not carbon copies of Silicon Valley models.",
      "Americans have ingenuity in making money. Indians have ingenuity in saving money. Bit oversimplified. But it tells you a lot about the differences in our risk appetite, startup culture, and investment/consumption ethos, Dilip Kumar.",
      "Interesting take Dilip Kumar Our challenges and expectations are different,  we should have our own system for sure",
      "Dilip Kumar Do you think this will actually happen in India?\nI believe this is a deep-rooted issue in the Indian mindset. I’ve studied a lot of YC content on fundraising, but what they teach doesn’t work in early-stage investor meetings in India. Investors rarely challenge their beliefs. To change this mindset, we need more founder-led early-stage funds.",
      "           I agree with your insights on the lower cost of risk and capital, but I respectfully disagree that we can't have a YC-equivalent here. If you look at the data from some of YC's batches, more than 50% of the companies originate from outside the U.S.\n\n          Take a look at the stats from the YC Summer 2021 batch:\n\n                    377 companies across 47 countries, representing over 4 billion people worldwide.\n                    About 50% of the companies were based outside the U.S.. Top countries, excluding the U.S., included:\n                    India (33)\n                    UK (18)\n                    Mexico (17)\n                    Canada (18)\n                    Brazil (11)\n                    Singapore (12)\n\n         These numbers demonstrate the growing global appeal and the increasing talent coming from non-U.S. countries. With India's thriving startup ecosystem and an abundance of entrepreneurial talent, there’s definitely potential to create a YC-like model right here.\n\n\"Bharat Combinator\" :) :) :) \n\nCiju Baby, COO, https://www.pplio.com",
      "Dilip Kumar I agree with your views. Unlike YC, the risk appetite of Investors here is not very high. As you mentioned, the investors at seed level also demand board seat and monthly reporting. I found the situation worse than this. The incubators and the Fund  Manager supported by the Govt fund are demanding Board Seats and higher dilution from ideation or pre-revenue stage startups. Even they demand Traction and ARR of 1cr or above from them with quite tougher term sheets...",
      "Dilip Kumar Thats exactly what we are doing at Upsparks Capital  we invest our money with our own conviction in pre-seed stage , invested in over 70 plus companies in last 5 years . Having built kaleyra previously we exactly know what a indian founder needs to build a startup from india 🇮🇳",
      "Dilip Kumar I agree with you! But when an entire society is obsessed about the tags of something (Ex-IIT/IIM/MAANG), copying a idea/mechanism that is successful elsewhere, we can’t expect better! \n\nEarly stage VC’s/Seed funding partners are evaluating any business idea on the parameter of Founding team Tags, revenue or product ready to market! No one are in a state of mind to groom or guide the new and innovative ideas. So there won’t be any YC or equivalent in India until someone who comes from humbled bg of no tags building successful ventures, moving to VC/AF and creating that specific ecosystem.\n\nIndia needs an ecosystem that guides, supports or invest in new ideas that are necessary for our real time problems! Not some fancy names or tags or some first copy versions of other country innovations",
      "True, pedigree and capital signal potential.\nBut trust is built through narratives that scale.\n\nBecause you can’t fundraise belief.",
      "Absolutely spot on, Dilip. YC wasn’t just capital it was cultural alchemy. India doesn’t need to mimic Silicon Valley; it needs to craft its own playbook. We need VCs who bet on grit over pedigree, skin in the game over spreadsheets. It’s time we build ecosystems that don’t just fund dreams but believe in them before they’re proven.",
      "From what I understand, this is the case because a lot of VC funds raise money from LPs that are not Indian and see these investments akin to the ones that are made in the public markets, backing the possibility of plain pecuniary return over taking the risk of funding something disruptive. Even the completely indian funds in terms of teams and LPs tend not to fund ideas till it has already generated some amount of traction - this significantly cuts down on the risk capital available for innovation that can disrupt the reality as we see today (say, for example flying taxis - a place where there is active investment in India). Even when such capital is available, it is available at tiny ticket sizes (INR 1- 2cr), which puts pressure on the innovator to continuously return to markets to raise money and move to market with either a product that's not too different from run of the mill products available to as the pressure to derisk more and more with for every new investment mounts.\nThe closest thing that I have seen to the Y-Combinator ecosystem in India are the IITM Incubation Cell and INCeNSE (IISc incubation cell), which work on innovative ideas that can make an impact.",
      "Very well put, Dilip.",
      "The conversation needs to shift from India-specific to world-specific. \nWith AI, more and more global problems are itching to be solved, and more and more Global startups will emerge.  From the USA, Israel, India, Africa...who knows?\nWe need to be global in our perspective and GLOBAL in our outcomes. Maybe China's already getting there before us. Let's catch up FAST ........",
      "Sharp take. India needs its own playbook, not a YC replica.Dilip Kumar",
      "Such a sharp take. YC wasn’t just a model, it was a moment. India needs its own story, not a copy. Love the call for founder-first support that truly fits our context.",
      "Brilliantly framed, Dilip Kumar . YC wasn’t built—it was emergent, born from a trust-first, failure-tolerant culture. India’s still in a ‘validation economy’—where degrees precede daring, and compliance precedes conviction. But our edge isn’t mimicry, it’s reinvention. We won’t have a YC because we don’t need one. What we’ll have is a founder-first, India-native capital stack—scrappy, skin-in-the-game, and grounded in solving for 1.4B. Prestige will follow outcomes, not pedigrees.",
      "Looks like a challenge to all. ",
      "I agree that while we have incredible talent, the surrounding support structures differ significantly. The focus on survival rather than scaling is indeed a critical challenge for many founders here. Rather than trying to replicate YC, perhaps we should champion the creation of a tailored ecosystem that prioritizes risk-taking and celebrates local success stories. ",
      "The funding ecosystem isn't just about copying structures Dilip, it's about understanding the unique DNA of a startup ecosystem. Our founders are resilient problem-solvers who need capital that truly gets their hustle.",
      "Dilip Kumar : how would define a micro vc in the indian context .. eg size of funds / investments being what? Also sector focused?",
      "Based on my limited understanding, YC is great at coaching founders and inculcating a high tolerance for failure. In India, the quality of entrepreneurship coaching and mentorship is limited to founders who have had scarcity/survival mindset hence you get an ecosystem limited to those type of founders. Also as the MD of one of India's largest companies once mentioned to me, Indians are fundamentally low integrity (dishonest)--which makes it difficult to have a YC like system in the first place. If you are fighting for survival and fear failure, it is not surprising that you are also dishonest--we will be incentivised to be high integrity if we live in a society that doesn't discrimnate against failure/mistakes. \n\nAt a base level, we lie because we are scared.",
      "Very insightful, thank you Dilip",
      "Second what Varun Aggarwala says in the comments. Our lack of vision and cohesiveness with executions backed by risk capital is our biggest Achilles heel. Long way to go till we have our own Gingko. We can keep on manufacturing cheap knock-offs of Whoop or some such service based products that bring us value, but tech that changes our way of life of impacts humankind will not originate in India. And that, I think is ok. The purpose of a business is to make money, as long as we make money from cheap knockoffs we should be happy about keeping our LPs on the same page. The sooner we accept this the better it is for us.",
      "KPH exists for the same reason!",
      "Loved this. So many points that really made me pause and reflect. India’s path will look different, and maybe that’s where the magic lies. Rooting for whatever version of founder first emerges here.\n",
      "I was discussing the same with someone this morning, the difference in looking at it from a 'Portfolio' perspective, vis-a-vis a 'Standalone' manner. YC does that, it allows companies in it's portfolio to fail, and it doesn't micro-manage - not every company can be a winner. ",
      "Dear Dilip Kumar: Y combinator focused on disruptive talent and deep-tech. Unfortunately most Indian VCs can't think beyond fraud snake oil peddling non scientific ventures (huge problem with talent in India too).\n\nGinkgo Bioworks needs a Y combinator and not Rainmatter.

    "text": "Because we invest in healthcare, I get this question all the time: Will AI replace doctors? As a technology optimist I don’t claim to have all the answers. But i feel this question usually reveals how little we understand both about AI & healthcare.\n\nWhen people say AI will replace doctors and teachers in the next decade. They  assume that intelligence is enough to make an impact and forgets that trust is the real currency in both healthcare and education.\n\nDoctors don’t just prescribe, they hold your hand during a cancer diagnosis. Teachers don’t just deliver content but they spot the kid falling behind, build confidence, and unlock potential. AI can assist, but it can’t replace human empathy and trust.\n\nSo is AI important? Absolutely.\nAI can read scans better than most radiologists. It can solve for homework & personalise lessons faster than a teacher. It can democratize access to world class knowledge, in any language, at near zero cost.\n\nBut can it replace the human relationship that sits at the core of these professions? AI doesn’t replace doctors. It replaces inefficiencies around them. Likewise AI won’t replace teachers. But it can free them from admin so they can actually teach\n\nTech is best when it’s invisible. When it supports human work & not erase it.\nYes, AI will change healthcare & education. The goal of AI shouldn't be to replace doctors & teachers.

      "Dilip Kumar is this true in the area of loneliness too? With so many AI chatbots getting developed to help people beat loneliness. \nI often question myself - Isn't that human touch, someone to hear me out makes the entire difference here ?",
      "Very true. Jhaadu Ki Jhappi will always be relevant, be it doctors or teachers.",
      "We couldn't agree more. At Telma AI, we build AI assistants to support people, not replace them. In healthcare, the human connection is irreplaceable. But what AI can do is take the busywork off people’s plates, giving them more space to prescribe and hold hands during a cancer diagnosis.",
      "This is such a thoughtful perspective. I completely agree that AI's role should be to enhance and support human efforts, not replace the empathy and trust that define professions like healthcare and education. The idea of AI addressing inefficiencies while allowing professionals to focus on what truly matters—human connection—is inspiring. Thank you for sharing this!",
      "Perfectly said. The real disruption in healthcare won't come from AI replacing doctors — it'll come from AI making it feel like every patient has a doctor who listens, remembers, and acts with insight. It's not about intelligence; it's about presence. And presence, especially in care, is built on trust — not just accuracy.",
      "Totally agree ..  🧑‍⚕️  + 🤖 >>  🧑‍⚕️",
      "AI can significantly enhance diagnostic accuracy, speed, and efficiency by analyzing complex data, identifying subtle anomalies in imaging, and even suggesting personalized treatment plans. This can reduce the workload of healthcare professionals, especially by automating routine or redundant tasks and streamlining processes.\n\nHowever, the adoption of AI depends heavily on doctors’ willingness to embrace new technology. Studies show that some physicians resist AI recommendations, especially when they conflict with their own judgment, often due to training gaps or concerns about professional credibility. This resistance can stem from traditional roles, perceived threats to expertise, or discomfort when patients arrive well-informed or with their own research.\n\nUltimately, for AI to reach its full potential in healthcare, there needs to be a cultural shift: doctors must be open to collaboration with AI, view it as a tool to augment rather than replace their expertise, and receive proper training to integrate AI insights into clinical decision-making. This partnership can lead to better patient outcomes and more human-centered care, provided both technology and mindsets evolve together.",
      "AI will certainly replace the kind of professionals ( including some kinds of doctors, lawyers, architects and many others ) who work at the back end -  with little human interaction. \n\nThe current inflexion point in human history due to AI seems to be very different from earlier shifts - at no point of time during the earlier revolutions did the Agency pass from human hands. Now - it is a matter of time before it does. \n\nThe development of AGI (only a matter of time) means we are possibly creating a species superior to Home Sapiens. And the second and third order effects of that will be dangerously unpredictable.",
      "The more I’m seeing/using AI, the more I’m liking it. I don’t think it’s replacing anyone, as far as you know how to use it well. We have to use it exactly how we started using the computers, to be more efficient and productive. That’s it. \n\nNot to give up your creativity and originality and definitely not to give up your core (whatever that core is).",
      "The empathy, along with the judgment required in teaching and treating, cannot be delivered by AI. However, in both professions, AI can support to excel.",
      "Thank you for sharing such a thoughtful perspective on the role of AI in healthcare and education. Your insights highlight the critical importance of human empathy and trust in these fields, which AI, despite its impressive capabilities, cannot replicate.\n",
      "AI is not just going to change the diagnosis landscape in the next couple of years, it will eventually even replace surgeons with finer and more precise abilities. That’s a space where the ultimate result matters way more than any other metrics.\nWith teachers I do believe there is an element of that extra, the extra push, that element of support and encouragement that’s very humane and may, may not be replaced fully. Though with AI taking over the knowledge imparting element very easily, the paradigm itself won’t have enough reference points to support having enough teachers with that / for that extraordinary element. It’s an interesting phase.",
      "AI can stretch the general levels of expertise available across the board and make it consistent and repeatable. In expert hands, it can push boundaries, and then make that the new normal. It's this multiplier effect that is exciting and game changing. \n\nQuoting from personal experience, I got a scan done and the radiologist at the diagnostic lab graded a module as TIRADS-4. But when the FNAC doesn't reveal anything and I got the scan done again by an experienced doctor this time, it was reclassified as TIRADS-3. A shadow seen earlier was wrongly thought to be solid cyst particles and the experienced doctor could call out the difference. If this expertise is fed into the reinforced learning loop of An AI system, it could have interpreted the scan correctly, the first time, saving all the trouble, anxiety and money.",
      "Brilliantly articulated Dilip Kumar.This perspective cuts through the noise around AI fear mongering. Trust, empathy, and human connection are irreplaceable especially in fields like healthcare and education where the stakes are deeply personal. AI should be seen as an enabler, not a replacement. The real innovation will lie in how we design systems that amplify human capability rather than attempt to mimic it. ",
      "ai won’t replace doctors, but it might change who (or what) patients are willing to trust in different moments.\n\nfor some, it’s still the human touch.\nfor others, it’s the privacy and immediacy of a well-designed system.\n\ntrust doesn’t always have to come from a person—sometimes it’s the design itself that makes people feel safe.",
      "AI is revolutionizing healthcare by enhancing diagnosis, training, and efficiency, but it cannot replace the trust, empathy, and human connection at the heart of the doctor-patient relationship—its real value lies in supporting and empowering clinicians, not replacing them",
      "Very well put. And I truly feel that while AI is great with many things, it is just not human, and this \"small difference\" makes a world of an impact!\n\nMy father was a teacher, and I hear from his students even today telling me about how he made them feel. Not what he taught, but the relationship he created with them, motivating, helping, sometimes even scolding. It is that entirety of his humanness that they remember. Not the lessons he taught!",
      "The Future is not ‘AI’ alone!\nIt’s ‘HUMAN + AI’ !\nAI will not Replace, it will Enhance Human!",
      "AI is needed to make tasks easier but it's not going to replicate human connection which is a core part of these jobs",
      "The worry is it can go the customer care way. While the back offices and customer care support teams have been a good addition overall, but it has put a layer between customer and team and we all have been there when we just want to pick up the phone and talk to someone. It doesn’t matter if AI is invisible or visible, what may matter more is it is putting more distance between doctor and patients or not",
      "So beautifully written.",
      "Can't agree more. Been at the intersection of both, Tech AI and the edtech/healthcare sectors, I've lived that fear of being redundant at some point. But the truth is, it's an enabler, not a replacement. The ability to understand the emotion, make the human being in front feel seen when backed with AI enhances and brings velocity to what we are solving for. The same goal to make them win.",
      "Unless we intend to make humans also think, behave and act like robots, AI will not be able to replace humans in many fields esp healthcare",
      "https://youtu.be/zyrvFuqfHWc?si=vjPzUGEbXxrKEJZ9",
      "As a PM in healthtech, I see this play out every day. AI isn’t here to replace doctors, it’s here to amplify their impact. \nWhether it’s helping triage faster, generating clinical summaries, or nudging patients toward better adherence, the best use of AI is when it fades into the background and empowers the human connection, not replaces it.",
      "A long time back when tele-health was at the top of the hype cycle, I told a high flying exec the same thing.. Healthcare and Education are high touch engagements.. You can use AI for many things including the diagnostics but AI cannot replace the human in the loop.. Case in point - We are building a product for therapy support but finer nuances of what's required in an Indian context is not something that the LLM could give you.. AI is limited to documented, training data and case studies on pub med, not the undocumented experience of meeting over 20-30 patients everyday with knowledge of local demographics, environment, climate, diet, endemic diseases etc. For that you need the human.",
      "Great post. As a doctor, my two bits is that accuracy alone isn’t enough, AI needs contextual judgment. If the training data reflects systemic gaps (like missed diagnoses in women or underrepresented populations), we risk scaling those inequities.\nTrust comes not just from empathy, but from transparency and accountability. The question isn’t just can AI outperform us? but can it understand why we choose what we do?\nThat said, I also believe AI can be a powerful force for good, especially in resource-constrained settings. Supporting overburdened systems, aiding early screening in rural areas, or reducing admin load. These are places where AI can genuinely improve access and outcomes.\nThe key is designing it to amplify the human, not replace it.",
      "Really appreciate this post Dilip Kumar, in fact ties in with my thoughts in the next post in my series on how 'AI WILL replace doctors' (caveats given there!). Trust, relationship building and empathy is actually largely missing in the chaos of the healthcare system today, and thats likely where AI will replace certain doctors. And the doctors left will have more time, space and emotional bandwidth to build trust, empathy and relationships with their patients. Because the point as you've mentioned isn't whether AI will or will not replace doctors, its how do we fix our broken healthcare system and improve health outcomes for all. Sumukh Mysore - our long standing conversation on this and my posts seems to be on everyones mind!",
      "Trust and empathy are all fine. But the REAL reason why AI will not replace a doctor is because you need HUMAN JUDGMENT for AI recommendations. And you need an expert (doctor) to exercise that judgment.\n\nTeachers are a different issue altogether. For children, especially young children, human interaction and guidance are required for various reasons. A robotic solution will soon work for this, but society will insist on human connections for very young minds. For older children and adults, there is no reason for human teachers to continue to exist, once robotic systems improve some more.",
      "Very rarely (almost never) have I felt any \"human relationship\" while visiting a doctor.",
      "Tech is Best with its invisible, Beautiful line.\nIn any business, the tech is just a facilitator, not the core.\n\nThe fate of an EdTech does not depend on the UI quality or the speed at which it can dish out content or evaluate sheets. It's the back-end data, the content, the live or virtual tutor who has drafted and crafted the content and how optimised it is kept.\n\nThe success of a fintech does not lie in how fast it allows you to make and break ur investments. It's the financial advice that it can provide. The back-end team can raise the red flags, help you distinguish the benefits of bonds and mutual funds, and so on.\n\nSimilarly, AI is another tech, it's just an enabler, facilitator, accelerator in many cases, it's not meant to and WILL NOT be replacing core functions like doctors and educators.",
      "Dilip, totally agree with your points. We should understand that AI or any path breaking tools is most critical to enhance the efficiency, precision and performance.  However the \"real\" decision will be routed by professionals driven by vast experience, Knowledge, reasoning and empathy. Though technology can identify and help connect data points, human intuition and wisdom alone can identify which of the critical data points to consider to make informed appropriate decisions.",
      "AI won’t replace doctors, but it will take care of most primary consultations and assist in clinical decision-making. AI agents can listen first, summarize fast, and support doctors with timely insights. The future of healthcare is human-led and AI-assisted.",
      "Being the first handler of AI-enabled products on ground, I see skepticism in the short term. But in the long run, AI won’t replace doctors, I feel it will become the silent backbone of healthcare enhancing decisions, reducing burnout and making quality care accessible at scale, without replacing the human touch.",
      "Totally agree!\n\nFirst, empathy can’t be replicated in machines. Both professions fuel on empathy. Besides, not only will AI change healthcare & education, it must. \n\nWays in which AI can assist healthcare practitioners in disease screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment is limitless. It’s an exciting time to witness the integration of ML and human health and disease.",
      "AI replacing doctors? That's like saying a stethoscope will replace a doctor. Sure, it amplifies sound, but it doesn't diagnose heartbeats with empathy. \nDilip, your perspective is spot on. AI is the sidekick, not the superhero. It handles the grunt work—like triaging and data crunching—while humans bring the heart and soul to healthcare and education. \nIn a world where trust is the real currency, AI can be the trusted assistant, but the human touch remains irreplaceable. Let's use AI to make a billion people feel like they finally have one. ",
      "Dilip Kumar very well said and resonates with the same thought I have, AI is here to stay and thrive but until it learns to have empathy and human emotions responses it will never be able to replace area’s where human touch is required. An interaction with doctor is not just transactional but most of the time half of patient’s problem goes away just by having interaction with doctor.",
      "Tech is best when it’s invisible - simple yet profound",
      "Yes it can in few situations. That's the reason inclusion of tech can get very critical here.\n\nIn few scenarios human becoming invisible also helps case to case basis. Toxicity and vengeance are often overlooked which AI may not bring to the table while interacting. \n\nFor eg \n\n\"ChatGPT fixed my 5-year jaw problem in a minute\"- LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman shares viral Reddit win that doctors missed\n\nhttps://m.economictimes.com/news/new-updates/chatgpt-fixed-my-5-year-jaw-problem-in-a-minute-linkedin-co-founder-reid-hoffman-shares-viral-reddit-win-that-doctors-missed/articleshow/120422455.cms",
      "This is absolutely true! We, as health tech founders are majorly focusing towards improving inefficiencies using AI. Can't wait to see what the future of healthcare in India looks like and we're glad to be a part of it.",
      "At the end of the day, AI isnt about displacing trust driven professions like healthcare and education.. The winners in this space won't be those who automate tasks for humans, but those who empower humans through technology.",
      "I guess over 50% of today's patient-doctor interactions are not as critical as cancer. They don't require hand-holding or empathy as much as they require efficiency in speed and cost. And if AI ends up reducing case load by even 10-20% there will be a substantial displacement happening.",
      "It will replace it for the people who are thinking things from practical aspect...",
      "Wonderfully articulated! ",
      "Tech is built by human so assuming tech will surpass humans is still just a misconception.",
      "The perspective on AI's healthcare impact lacks specificity. In a nation with a severe scarcity of doctors, and where access to highly skilled physicians is even more limited, AI offers a significant solution. It can begin by addressing the shortage through improved triaging and may eventually automate much of primary healthcare.",
      "“AI doesn’t replace doctors, it replaces inefficiencies around them” is potentially my favourite use case of AI. Help doctors do the administrative and scheduling tasks, especially related to insurance, and let them focus on providing empathy driven care to their patients.",
      "In Indian context, the goal of making a billion people feel like they finally have access to Education & Healthcare is pretty much non-negotiable. I would extend this to the whole of 'Global South', which has been short on basic amenities. AI can and (ideally), should be used to augment & scale human capabilities to enable access to all. Because if the focus remains only on productivity & profitability, it is likely to lead to massive social disruptions. ",
      "Amazing thought process Dilip Kumar! Human relationship is the core of healthcare delivery, and the compassion that humans can show each other can surely not be replaced by AI.",
      "Most of us already do a google search of our symptoms and perform self diagnosis and self prescription .. I think there will be use cases where AI will replace if the price is going to be near to zero",
      "Absolutely nailed it!\nGreat to know that what goes beyond treatment is appreciated in today's chaotic healthcare scenario. The core of healthcare is the silent support a doctor gives as a gentle touch on hand to say I'm there for you, an empathetic ear to hear the challenges a patient faces as a person, leaving aside the medical concerns. The extra touch that goes in is sharing lives as human beings. What a teacher can do cannot be replaced..\nThe inspiration and the motivation \nAI can't sure see your capabilities which a mentor can envision or a doctor who can connect with their patient at all levels.\nIt's a bond of a lifetime!",
      "AI can assist, but it can’t replace human empathy and trust. If it exists in teachers & Doctors, they're rare to find\nWrong Diagnosis, unwanted tests, investigations,surgeries to make few bucks, have become the norm \nRather than instilling confidence, I have seen them shatter the child, teaching has become a side hustle to make some easy money than the upbringing of a child with healthy mind & body\nI address victims of both these professions daily , the pain trauma instilled in them, makes me wonder ,once called Noble professions has become money making machine",
      "The line - \"tech is best when it's invisible\" is super super super deep and insightful. Thanks for that! \n\nPlus, the insight about AI removing the friction is exactly what Mihir has been talking to me about for so long. He says that AI and human experts will co-exist and enable each other to serve others. \n\nThanks for the post, Dilip! ",
      "Exactly - it's like people are accusing calculators will replace all mathematicians!"

    "text": "Everyone today loves this grand narrative that \"Tech will fix everything\". Every week a news article or investor confidently declares that tech will fix healthcare & most entrepreneurs fall for this illusion of disruption. This narrative is doing more harm than good.\n\nMost entrepreneurs today think, if we can build a beautifully designed app, use AI to chat, automate doctor-patient interactions, and scale it to millions of users, we can \"solve\" healthcare. \n\nIt sounds great in a pitch deck. It almost never works in reality.\n\nWhy? Because healthcare isn't e-commerce. You can’t scale a hospital bed like a food delivery fleet. You can’t disrupt chronic disease with a better UI. You can’t solve trust with a chatbot. Healthcare isn’t a transaction, it’s a relationship.\n\nIf you're serious about fixing healthcare, start thinking from first principles.\n\nEveryone wants to build the “Uber of Healthcare.” But Uber works because a ride from point A to B is a simple transaction. Healthcare isn’t. You can’t just match a patient with a doctor and assume the job is done. Don't build a generic doctor consultation app with a new UI or a marketplace that lists thousand doctor names. Focus on depth of care, outcomes, and follow-up treatments before chasing millions of users. Build a connected system that only focuses on driving outcomes.\n\nDon't over focus on AI without fixing the basics. AI can help a doctor diagnose faster. But it can’t replace the doctor. Yet, doctors alone won’t solve India’s healthcare crisis. They also need trained frontline workers assisted by smart tech. Build AI tools to assist doctors enable faster diagnoses. Don't oversell your AI engine or LLM models to a patient. \n\nIt doesn’t matter if we have the best doctor or AI engine if the right medicine isn’t available. Up to 20% of medicines sold in India are fake or substandard. Counterfeit drugs are a massive problem & the Pharma companies are growing this $58 billion market. Perhaps a great usecase to use AI and tech to streamline the supply chain. \n\nSo, can tech fix healthcare? Yes. \nBut not by replacing doctors, hospitals, or traditional care systems. The biggest healthcare opportunities in India are not about disruption but augmentation.\n\nTech alone won’t fix Indian healthcare. But finding the right places to apply can make a 10x difference.

      "Brilliantly articulated. Tech has a huge role to play, but only when it's grounded in the realities of how healthcare actually works. It’s not just about building sleek apps or throwing AI at the problem. They can support, not solve.",
      "Humans have the insight so the AI would know and not have hallucinations.",
      "Well Said...\nDoctors do need a lot of support tech to bolster their practice..\nUnfortunately the tug of war between the primacy of the tech platform \"enrolling\" doctors and a doctor deploying tech, has created a kind of a deadlock and not allowed tech to actually revolutionise healthcare delivery..",
      "This is why we eVitalRx have been building for 4 years an infrastructure and now we launched PillO: Meds in Minutes to make medicines accessible when we need the most - aka qCommerce. Would love to speak to you about it.",
      "A sharp, much-needed reality check—tech can enhance healthcare, but only when it respects its complexity, not oversimplifies it.",
      "That's a good perspective on 'Tech will fix everything' narrative, especially in healthcare where distruption does not necessarily mean putting AI between a patient & the healthcare professional but rather AI around them so that the cluttered processes, wait times, etc can be reduced. I came across few MVPs & products recently which are designing LLM's for mental health space which a patient can access to & talk to before connecting to an actual professional. ",
      "Exactly. True innovation isn’t just about technology—it’s about understanding the real-world challenges and applying tech where it actually moves the needle. The best solutions don’t disrupt for the sake of it; they enhance what already works.",
      "Tech can’t replace relationships, trust, or outcomes in healthcare. Augmentation, not disruption, is the real game-changer—piece by piece, not overnight. Spot on! Dilip Kumar",
      "True,it must be built brick by brick, with careful consideration of the risks involved.",
      "Bharosa AI is doing exactly that - \"the focus on depth of care and outcomes part\", especially.",
      "On point",
      "Dilip Kumar\n\nThis is such a solid take! \n\nThe whole \"Uber of Healthcare\" narrative oversimplifies a deeply complex system. \n\nHealthcare isn't just about transactions; it's about trust, continuity, and outcomes.\n\nTech can absolutely help, but not in the way most startups imagine—slapping AI on everything and calling it \"disruption\" isn’t the answer. \n\nInstead, the real impact comes from augmenting the system: improving diagnostics, streamlining supply chains, ensuring medicine authenticity, and empowering frontline workers.\n\nIt’s refreshing to see a take that focuses on first principles rather than just chasing scale. \n\nThe biggest wins in healthcare won’t come from the flashiest tech but from solving real, foundational problems.",
      "\" The biggest healthcare opportunities in India are not about disruption but augmentation\" - Excellent observation. Request you to write your views on the role of Govt in healthcare when you get some time....",
      "Techie just a “tool” that can help in the process.\n\nMINDSET change is the only way this can happen in a sustained way and for the long term.\n\nAnd, it needs to be done with the youth in India.\n\nCurrent emphasis is still on visual aesthetics vs real health…””looking” good being the primary emphasis.\n\nAlso, there’s a need to put more messaging out that shows the connection between physical exercise and mental health.",
      "Tech can’t fix everything, but it can amplify what works. Focus on meaningful upgrades, not overnight disruption. Slow, steady, and impactful wins the race.",
      "Well said! Focusing on augmentation rather than disruption is the key to meaningful progress in healthcare.",
      "Healthcare management is a multifaceted field that requires a blend of strategic decision-making, human empathy, regulatory compliance, and real-time problem-solving. It involves coordinating medical professionals, managing resources, ensuring patient safety, and navigating complex healthcare policies—all while maintaining a patient-centered approach. While AI tools can enhance efficiency by analyzing data and automating administrative tasks, they lack the nuanced judgment, ethical reasoning, and interpersonal skills necessary for effective leadership. The ability to address unforeseen challenges, mediate conflicts, and make holistic decisions based on both data and human factors ensures that healthcare management remains an indispensable human-driven profession. \nThank you for pointing that out sir! 👍🏽😊 Dilip Kumar",
      "Great advice!",
      "Dilip, this was an absolute reality check disguised as a masterclass in common sense! Guess we’re all guilty of thinking “If it works for pizza delivery, it must work for healthcare too.” It’s like trying to fix a broken leg with free Wi-Fi – not exactly what the doctor ordered.",
      "Tech isn’t the cure, but it can be the catalyst.",
      "Love this note, Dilip!\nWe work in a different industry [concrete/ construction], but much of these principles/ learnings apply there as well!",
      "THIS!",
      "100%\nThis post will age well and I am sure within the next 2-3 years, there will be a lot of startups validating this post.",
      "Finally, a take that doesn’t fall for the “AI will save the world” fantasy.\n\nToo many startups believe better UI + AI chatbot = healthcare revolution. But healthcare isn’t a checkout cart—it’s a life-and-death relationship.\n\nBiggest takeaway? Tech should augment, not replace.\n\n- AI can assist doctors, but it won’t replace experience and trust.\n- A sleek app won’t fix supply chain chaos or fake medicine issues.\n- Scaling care isn’t about matching patients to doctors—it’s about ensuring follow-up, outcomes, and real impact.\n\nIf you’re serious about “fixing” healthcare, stop chasing disruption hype and start solving real problems.",
      "I get it. Every entrepreneur wants to build the ‘Uber of Healthcare.’ But unlike booking a ride, healthcare is personal, complex, and needs constant care. If you’re serious about making a difference, focus on augmenting existing systems with tech that enhances doctor-patient relationships and improves outcomes, not just on scaling for scale’s sake.",

      "Finally someone called it out.",
      "Dilip Kumar You hit the nail on the head, and I hope investors see it that way too.",
      "What if we invert the problem? Instead of asking how tech can fix healthcare, ask how healthcare can evolve to leverage tech. Consider second-order effects: how can we redesign healthcare systems to naturally integrate AI, blockchain, and IoT, creating a symbiotic relationship that amplifies human expertise and trust?",
      "Doctors are usually the most inefficient point in the journey from ailment to healing. \n\nTechnology can definitely improve this inefficiency through multiple means. Removing the bottleneck, or offering alternate solutions should be a priority for anyone trying to solve for this.",
      "I second your thoughts..\nWe don’t need to disrupt healthcare, but to transform it.\nMake it accessible to everyone, make it efficient and portable (where one patient can move to another facility without carrying a big pile of records, just like EHR/FHIR in US) and most importantly help frontline workers in rapid diagnosis.\nThe truth is, we have the basic infrastructure required to accomplish all these things, but the people who can make it happen are not so willing to make it happen.\nExample -\nWe already have Aadhar in place, equavelant to SSN in US, all we need to create a centralised system where every detail, every visit, every hospitalisation along with diagnoses and treatment gets updated in the real-time , making it easy to access by healthcare professionals at patient visit.\nIndia has a very large talent pool and most of it is busy in job hunt whereas we are lagging behind in AI innovation, why not using it to become an AI powerhouse?\nWhich can transform healthcare, environment and whatnot!",

      "I couldn’t agree more! Healthcare, especially when it comes to optimizing functional health, isn’t a one-size-fits-all problem. Even if we set aside the absolute need for empathy in wellness transactions, the simple fact that we are all bio-individuals means no two imbalances are identical.\n\nML &AI are not replacements for human expertise but critical tools in advancing research, enabling deeper insights from biodata. These technologies are essential for identifying patterns & forming the backbone of personalized interventions.\nThis is exactly where we are focused—developing biodata-driven solutions that integrate 100% clean health supplementation and precision nutrition. ",
      "on point. tech is ONLY an enabler. it's what you aim to solve, how you solve and consistently so - that's what matters.",
      "AI can suggest, but it can’t decide. The real focus should always remain in doctor-patient relationship.",
      "Apart from just technology, with the corporatisation of healthcare services, driven by a profit motive- we really need to think about whether they have the right incentives at hand to focus on health.",
      "If smart watch or phone could make people smarter then we wouldn't be dumb to believe that wearing a smart watch, or ring would make us healthy",
      "Rightly said! The notion that tech alone can 'disrupt' healthcare oversimplifies the complexity of human well-being. Real impact comes from thoughtful integration — using tech to empower doctors and frontline workers.",
      "Dear Dilip, refer any statistics of metabolic illnesses, the prevalence is directly proportional with availability of medical resources and information. Rich vs poor, worker vs executive, rural vs urban etc., Health is multifactorial and related to natural lifestyle. Planning health itself is a deviation. Most wealthy individuals have poor healthspan and is due to additional stress associated with wealth. \nBiggest illness of humans unlike other organisms is greed to accumulate more than required, in all terms. \nAI shall be worsening health parameters at a faster pace than before due to associated stress inputs... \nThe earlier major disruptions in humans that affected health majorly were\n1. Discovery of fire\n2. Invention of wheel",
      "True... AI shouldn’t be everywhere, especially at the fundamental level.  AI can help reduce friction and make processes faster for both doctors and patients, but it’s not the solution for everything. \nFixing the right problem should be the focus 👍 \nDilip Kumar Good post",
      "UI alone won’t fix the lack of infrastructure or disrupt chronic diseases. But a well-designed user experience—one that aligns with users' digital learning curve and mental model—can make health-tech advancements truly scalable, usable, and impactful.\n\nUX in digital healthcare isn’t an afterthought; it’s the difference between adoption and abandonment. There’s a reason WhatsApp is ubiquitous—it works for people, not against them. We need healthcare solutions that do the same—solutions that adapt to users, not ones that force users to adapt. ✨",
      "I think the bigger use cases of Tech / AI in Healthcare are in the non-consumer facing side. On the consumer side, as rightly pointed out it is more about augmentation. On the other hand, Tech can bring about disruption in the areas of drug discovery, clinical trials, radically improved therapies for life threatening conditions, diagnostics etc. ",
      "Before building the App one should understand how the healthcare system works on the Ground. Before building atleast once visit the hospital to know how the system works.",
      "Very informative, Tech alone won’t fix Indian healthcare, where doctor shortages (1:1,511), poor rural access (600M people), and 20% counterfeit drugs persist. Unlike e-commerce, healthcare needs trust, continuity, and affordability not just AI chatbots or doctor-matching apps. The real opportunity is in augmenting care- scaling AI-assisted frontline workers, securing drug supply chains, and improving patient outcomes. Disruption won’t work, but smart, systemic upgrades will.",
      "I have a question: When we say fix it! We presume it’s broken. \n\nWhat if we see the world as not broken but as something that’s evolving. \n\nWhen we see it as broken we reject it! If you break a bone, see the Dr. If it breaks twice, increase calcium and get healthier. \n\nIf it breaks thrice, then go to a Therapist to understand what you need to do in your frequency. \n\nIt’s evolution, healthcare needs to evolve to cover all aspects of health.",
      "Tech is a commodity and accessibility & simplification of AI tools will commoditize it even further!",
      "Great Line - \"Don't over focus on AI without fixing the basics\". Conceptualizes the entire discussion around AI. "

    "text": "Gopi is right. The reality is brutal—less than 1% of aspiring athletes make it big, and even those who do are left with little security once their careers are over. Sports, like startups, have a power law distribution—10% of players make 90% of the money. Everyone else is a statistic.\n\nWe love to read and watch the underdog story—the kid from nowhere who makes it to the top. But that’s survivorship bias. For every one success, there are tens of thousands who trained just as hard but got nothing. The real question is: why does sports have to be a gamble?\n\n If you’re not in the top 1%, you don’t get sponsorships, you don’t have financial security, and once your career ends—usually in your late 20’s or early 30s—you’re left scrambling for what’s next.\n\nIn developed nations, sports is a structured industry. There are leagues, second-tier careers, college scholarships, and post-career pathways. \n\nIf you don’t become an Olympic champion, you can still earn a living as a coach, analyst, trainer, or minor league player. The system doesn’t discard you the moment you’re not in the top 1%.\n\nThe problem isn’t that sports is hard—it’s that failure is absolute. An engineer who fails at a startup can get a job. A failed athlete? They often have nothing. That’s why in most countries without strong sports ecosystems, success in sports correlates with wealth. You can’t afford to be an athlete unless you can afford to lose.\n\nRight now, telling a poor kid to pursue sports is like telling them to buy lottery tickets as an investment strategy. Until we change that, Gopi’s words will remain true. And that’s a failure—not of the athletes, but of the system.\n\nA great sports system doesn’t just create champions—it creates a nation of resilient, disciplined, and competitive people. And that’s the foundation of real development.",

      "Breaking the problem:\n\n1. I think the same applies to any \"one\" career one might choose, it becomes a single point of failure for \"most\" people. I have heard this from a swimming instructor/ coach: 1 life 3 careers (practiced in Germany?). This helps in life beyond sports for professionals. This applies to anyone in normal walks of life as well I guess.\n\n2. Irrespective sports must be played for fun or passion and the discipline, and the outcomes must be a by-product and I feel there is often a rat race in every sport in many countries and on top of that, in most cases the parents/ guardian of the kids are responsible for kid's journey, this happens more often in growing economies like India. It takes 2-3 generations to build sports into the genes of a nation (physically - naturally).\n\n3. Most people do not know the donts and do's of any sport, and they practice it without understanding the science behind (bio mechanics, nutrition, character building etc)",
      "Very well put !",
      "Playing sports is not always about winning or making it a career. It is about staying physically active, building team spirit, and collaboration.\nIt is not a failure if one does not get into a national team. If that is the thinking behind playing sports, then one should look at why one studies engineering, medicine, or any other discipline. Not every engineer will become CTO, or every doctor will become Surgeon General.\n\nThe focus in playing sports should be a healthy body and a healthy mind.",
      "Totally agree",
      "Where there is a will there is always a way......I believe that your passion has nothing to do with rich and poor.... ofcourse if you are rich it helps you alot but we have seen examples of many athletes who have been poor and against all odds they have become successful and inspiration for many young people. Same thing goes in each and every aspect of life. If someone from humble background can do it....we can also do it.",
      "Agree",
      "100% agree.  Kind of a weird article and post.  There are a lot of very good reasons for kids to play sports, completely unrelated to making it a career. That’s why I made my kids all pick one and participate.  (If a scholarship resulted, that would have been nice, but they inherited my genes.)",
      "Totally agree with his assessment \nIn our country the lack of proper trainers and diet for the poor people who want to pursue sports is glaring. It results in too many injuries.\n\nDestroying the life of 100 to make 1 champion in a sport is not worth it",
      "Harsh but truth reality in India for sports",
      "The problem will look very different light if we can shift the focus on district level development.\n\nWe have shot the bullet on our feet by encouraging mindless glorification of wins in major events.\n\nThe baseline reference for success, according to me needs to be relooked into.\n\nThe sports governing bodies must be made accountable to have LTDP.\nDemocratizing the structures, in my view can give us much needed lever to make things work.\n\nUnless we set the context of \"why sports?\" and have a very powerful and most inclusive answer to this question, all the solutions will boomrang.\n\nIn reality there are no eco-system. Ecosystem is constituted by it's stakeholders. So if we pivot our understanding from this. The question that emerges is which organisation / institution  or individual in India has what at stake ???\nThe athelete and parents and coaches at the grassroots who have huge stakes doen not matter to the leaders at the helm of the affairs. These leaders are Sports ministry, SAI, International Bodies of Sports and National, State Federations. \nWhy can we not call out names and adress the issues straight. \nModerations won't work. \nEvery game is played by set / agreed upon rules.\nDo we have rules for sports ?",

      "Dilip, you’ve nailed it. I’ve watched close friends pour their hearts into sports, only to find themselves with no safety net when they didn’t ‘make it.’ It’s heartbreaking that something as character-building as athletics becomes such a risky gamble. Like you said, it’s not the hard work that’s the problem—it’s that failure can be so final. If we truly want a sports culture that benefits everyone, we need more than just a few superstars. We need pathways for the other 99%—opportunities to coach, mentor, and contribute without being written off. Until that happens, parents who hesitate about sports for their kids aren’t being pessimistic; they’re being practical.",
      "It’s not about the money. \n\nPlay sports!",
      "The real issue isn’t that sports are a gamble. It’s that some countries lack the structure to support athletes beyond the top 1%. It’s a system problem not a sports problem. In countries with strong sports cultures, even mid-tier athletes find careers as coaches, analysts, trainers, sports scientists, physiotherapists, and administrators. The ecosystem sustains itself.",
      "I have worked with 100s of kids and helped them be better Footballers and Athletes. The lesson I got from my time as a player and a coach is to always push kids to be educated and develop skills that can make them self sustainable and not rely on a sports setup like ours. \n\nI couldn’t play pro, but I managed to work in the industry and pivot because I was always learning and was in love with the idea of sports than the sports itself. Work to be a pro, but plan for failure too because this is a fragile industry and support is minimal. Gopi is correct and I still talk to my kids and tell them to complete their education irrespective of what level you are playing at and work on skills around the game.

Diving deeper, what is the problem, and what can we do different?\n\n3. One problem is that kids are expected to pick their career by the age of 15, and stick with the rest of their life! That is an unrealistic expectation. We should encourage people to switch careers later in life. Nothing  wrong in continuing education later in life. I know people in the US go to Undergrad or Post Grad education as late as their 50s. People change their careers late in life, and multiple times. \n\n4. Hiring managers should not disregard people changing their careers later in life. The hiring process should only focus on one question \"Can this person do the job I want to hire them for?\" It doesn't matter when they switched to that job, or went to school for it.\n\n5.

Inexpensive training Arenas with fully equipped facility for people who wish to go into sports.\n2. Teachers recruited by the government for training in those arenas with equal pay rights.\n\nHigher the no. Of people participating higher the chances of goods talents actually appearing on top, and that 1% can atleast become 1.5% given we will have a strong base so more people will get the medals for the country.\n\nI don't think asking people to not participate in sports will help the country to grow internationally in sports it will grow by creating a system that supports to find and boast the real talent to participate and balance to be able to grow in other aspects be it educational.",

      "Gopi is right.\nSports are for the extreme rich and extreme poor.\n\nExample - Sons of Rich guys like Kumara Mangalam Birla, Tendulkar's son, Rahul Dravid's Son etc. \n\nReason is simple, rich becomes complacent and lazy. Sports means - need to work hard, take proper care of health and results are measurable. Will teach you that win/lose is not guaranteed and makes you more matured as you get to realize that success/failure is not directly proportional to efforts and so many things like team/situation/weather and other things play a role.\n\nFor the poor, anyway, nothing to lose and there is a lot of support and money in sports these days. You can show your hunger and character and make it big.\n\nLast thing a middle class guy should do is to send their kids to sports as it is highly risky. Kids will end with super rich who don't care about money and super poor who don't have anything to lose. Lot of kids come and go in-between and if you lose out on important years (8th to 12th) you will end up as illiterate who cannot study complex stuff like mathematics, science, finance etc.\n\nIt is also dangerous for middle class kids to hang around with illiterate kids and illiterate support staff and management in our sports ecosystem.

But if a kid has passion and talent, they should go for their calling. \n\nI fully agree that you have to plan for a career after the sports stint - and I believe athletes in the US plan for it, and good ones also are financially prudent with their investments early on! Sports is a formal industry here. \n\nWish there were more folks in India who were passionate about formalizing this career path and think of how skills learned here (and they’re valuable) can be leveraged in another fields. For example, in the US, being a military veteran can be a prized background in corporate backgrounds. Could there be something similar in India as well? \n\nJust some thoughts - maybe not thought out as well as I would like to, but we have to do our part to power and enable talent in all fields in coming generations!",

Already we have many hurdles in sports creating a new one is horrible.\nInstead have some good jobs for such sports personnel who can't go through.",
      "Well said! The harsh reality is that talent and hard work alone aren’t enough in sports—without the right ecosystem, most athletes are left with nothing once their careers end. \nWe need a system that supports athletes beyond just the top 1%—providing career pathways, financial security, and structured opportunities.

People are severely underpaid, and most organisations are exploiting the passion driven youth who have chosen sport as a career. \n\nI have come across many cases of not just players but also the staff of clubs and  corporates alike, not getting paid their promised salaries. Such players are left helpless and cashless, moving on - while their previous workplace finds another person willing to be underpaid or has no idea that they might never get paid. \n\nSo yes, we need a heavy revamp in the entire ecosystem.",

Socially, it introduces them to kids from all different socioeconomic backgrounds, mentally, it teaches them grit & resilience which is an immeasurable benefit throughout their entire life and physically, I don’t think we even need to go into the childhood obesity epidemic. If kids look to professional athletes and use that to drive and motivate them in ways similar to adults looking at CEO’s and entrepreneurs and say, “I want that, I can do that!”,  I think it’s normal and natural.  Things go awry when parents push their kids to be someone else. Letting your kid lead and start their own engine. If you’re constantly “starting your kid’s engine” (quoting the great Pat Summitt) to be something and getting resistance, it’s not worth it financially, mentally emotionally. Let them develop a passion and reap the benefits of sports. I think parents play a role in the introduction of sports and kids take the resigns from there. The return on investment is huge in the end.",

    "text": "Building a business in preventive health is hard. No one tells you this upfront. I learned it the hard way, first as a founder, now as an investor.\n\nYou’ve chosen the harder game. Not because prevention doesn’t work, but because people don’t pay for it. Most wake up thinking about chai, parathas , deadlines, and school fees. Not long-term health. People today want instant gratification—sugar today, gym tomorrow.\n\nCurative health makes money because illness is urgent. No one postpones a bypass surgery or negotiates an ICU bill. But prevention? Everyone hunts for gym discounts, coupon codes for healthy food and thinks twice before paying for a fitness program.\n\nHospitals & pharma companies thrive because they sell relief from suffering. And suffering is a guaranteed market—prevention is not.\n\nThat’s why venture money chases curative health—it scales fast with clear unit economics, solving problems people can’t ignore. Asking someone to eat better, sleep more, and exercise for a payoff 5–10 years later is like selling an FD over a lottery ticket. So accept this reality and build accordingly.\n\nYet, prevention is the hardest problem and the biggest untaped opportunity.\n#1 Healthcare in India will shift to prevention-not because people suddenly care, but because not caring is becoming too expensive. \n\n#2 Your market isn’t TAM, it’s WTM (willing-to-pay market). Everyone should care about health, but few will pay for it.To go mass-market, make it cheaper than chai and as seamless as WhatsApp.\n\n#3 If you’re selling prevention, reposition it. People don’t buy prevention. They buy status, performance, and convenience. Make it aspirational & competitive.\n\n#4 Trust in health isn’t built overnight. People won’t change their habits because you raised venture money. You’re in the business of delayed gratification. That means slow &sustainable growth.\n\n#5 If your product doesn’t make people healthier or keep them engaged long-term, the number of app downloads doesn't matter. Focus on retention, real outcomes and revenue—not GMV, DAUs or metrics to make a pitch deck look good. \n\nIf you can do this, you won’t just build a business—you’ll change how India thinks about health. And that’s worth building for.",

      "This post deeply resonates with me. As a founder of a preventive health startup back in 2018, I learned firsthand how hard it is to sell prevention in a world wired for quick fixes.\n\nHaving lost both my parents to chronic diseases, I’ve seen the devastating impact of neglected health choices up close. The irony? People turn a blind eye to things until they become chronic issues—whether it’s mental health, metabolic dysfunction, or lifestyle-driven conditions. And when they do act, it’s often driven by fear, not foresight.\n\nPrevention isn’t just a business challenge, it’s a behavioral challenge. People take anecdotal evidence over data, ignore long-term risks, and only act when the cost of inaction becomes unbearable. The real shift will happen when prevention isn’t sold as ‘healthcare’ but as status, performance, and convenience—things people already prioritize.\n\nIf we want prevention to win, we have to meet people where they are. Make it frictionless, rewarding, and aspirational. Package it in a way that taps into what they already desire—confidence, success, and longevity. Build for behavior, not just health outcomes. Because the real challenge isn’t making prevention work—it’s making people care before it’s too late.",

      "Dilip Kumar Reading this made me think about safety—much like preventive health, no one wants to pay for it until disaster strikes. In my early 20s, I was working on a project called SAFER (Safety Awareness, First Aid, and Emergency Response) to set up safety protocols for institutions, especially smaller organizations.\n\nWhat I observed was shocking—even schools barely comply with fire safety norms, no drills are conducted, and organizations ignore even the minimum compliance standards. Yet, there’s no mindset to pay for safety, even though it’s critical.\n\nJust like preventive health, disaster preparedness isn’t ‘urgent’—until it’s too late. Projects like these need resource backing and policy push to be sustainable. But even CSRs hesitate to invest in them. Prevention may be a hard sell, but the cost of ignoring it is catastrophic",

      "Gourav Nishad",
      "Dilip Kumar I disagree with your premise. Preventive healthcare is hard because nobody wants to put in the work. Brands tend to rely on influencers to sell rather than educating the audience how they can truly understand their body. You would rarely find brands building communities solely for the purpose of educating people. \nHealth is not aspirational. It is the dire need of the moment. You can't cheat your audience by promising 6-pack abs and a calisthenic body just in 30 days. Preventive health doesn't need to be glamourised but portrayed as exactly what it is. It needs to be worked upon, and not just for 3 months or 6 months but for a lifetime. \nIf you think people don't care about preventive health, look at the LinkedIn feed around filled with people prioritizing mental health over a secure way of paying their bills.",
      "Agreed, preventive health is tough but crucial. FITTR is a great example of a startup getting it right",
      "Nobody wants to pay just to look and feel the same—they want visible, rapid improvement. But in many cases, that’s not realistic. The truth is, maintaining your current health and preventing decline is an achievement in itself.\nThe challenge? People don’t value what they don’t notice. Without experiencing improvement, it’s hard to appreciate that prevention is progress. That’s why most only learn its importance after suffering. The real opportunity in preventive health is changing this mindset before it’s too late.",
      "In a larger context it's applicable everywhere - people more often than not want to solve a problem after it has occurred... prevention is hardly appreciated and rarely attempted.\n\nOne of the best preventive technique in life is good education... but try selling good education to parents - the conversation starts with what's the price instead of starting with what will you teach.",

The challenge isn’t just awareness; it’s changing human behavior, which is infinitely harder than treating a crisis.\n\nBut the beauty of this challenge is that it demands a full-stack solution—not just another fitness program, diet plan, or wearable, but an integrated ecosystem that makes prevention effortless, accessible, and rewarding. Enough talk about why prevention is hard; it's time to build a system where prevention just works—seamlessly embedded in daily life, removing friction, and delivering value upfront instead of years later.\n\nThe real opportunity isn’t in convincing people to care about health but in designing a model where they don’t have to think about it—where prevention happens automatically. That’s the real full-stack story.",

Out of personal interest, Ive been diving deep into preventive health lately, exploring many theories on a wide-spectrum of opinions.\n\nThen, as I try to ADVOCATE for it with people I care about…. Well, your post perfectly captures the challenge!\n\nPrevention’s real competition isn’t \"curative health,\" it’s Netflix and junk food. The battle is as much about wallets (prioritizing fast vs delayed gratification) than it is for attention.\n\n→ How do we make healthy choices (active) as irresistible as passive scrolling?\n\nFrom my limited experience, I conclude the problem boils down to a combination of \"self-hypnosis\" and \"apathy.\"\n\n- People think they’re invincible (until they’re not.)\n- People don't want to think about what scares them (aka Ostrich Policy).\n\nPrevention doesn’t sell because it’s TOO POLITE. Because it's sold to the WRONG INSTINCTS.\n\nIt's sad, but people don’t act until they’re scared or shamed. Not because they need \"more education\" and \"awareness campaigns.\"\n\nWHAT IF prevention didn't shy away from BRUTAL HONESTY?\n\n→ “You’re not tired, you’re UNFIT\"\n→ \"You’re not busy, you’re UNDISCIPLINED”\n\nCould truth sell better than hope? It'd polarize more, for sure. But the \"net effect?\"",

      "Couldn't agree more!",
      "Absolutely agree—building a business in preventive health is tough. But there's another challenge we often overlook: the way we define \"healthcare\" itself.\n\nToday, most of what we call healthcare is actually disease care—reactive solutions rather than proactive well-being. Prevention isn't just a \"good-to-do\" habit; it's a way of life. And to make it mainstream, we need to rethink how it's positioned.\n\n✅ Wellness isn’t expensive—it’s misunderstood.\nPreventive health can be as affordable as a monthly grocery budget. The real gap isn’t cost; it’s knowledge. This is where professionals, doctors, and health experts play a crucial role—not just in treatment, but in making prevention practical and attractive.\n\n✅ Behavior change isn’t about logic, it’s about desire.\nTelling people to avoid unhealthy habits isn’t enough. Just like kids need a candy to build a habit, adults need incentives to embrace prevention. The best health solutions don’t just inform—they inspire and integrate into daily life seamlessly.\n\nIf prevention is the future of healthcare, then professionals must sell what people want to deliver what they need. That’s how we shift from a reactive system to a truly preventive one.\n\n#Healthcare #PreventiveHealth #Wellness",
      "Indeed a hard domain. health is often overlooked until something goes wrong. People tend to prioritize work, entertainment, and other responsibilities while neglecting their well-being. But when health issues arise, everything else takes a backseat. Needs a creative approach to solve this 😊 ",
      "Same with Physiotherapy!\nIn today’s healthcare market, people readily spend on expensive treatment packages filled with machines and passive modalities but hesitate to pay for a physiotherapist’s consultation. This mindset neglects the true value of physiotherapy—expert assessment, movement correction, and guided rehabilitation.\nWhile modalities like ultrasound, IFT, and TENS may provide temporary relief, they do not address the root cause of pain or dysfunction. True healing and long-term recovery come from a physiotherapist’s expertise in hands-on therapy, exercise prescription, and most importantly, preventive healthcare.\nPhysiotherapy is not just about treating pain; it is about preventing it. Regular assessments, posture correction, and guided exercises can help avoid chronic conditions, improve mobility, and enhance overall well-being. Investing in a physiotherapy consultation isn’t just about recovery—it’s about building a healthier, pain-free future.",

      "The solutions available (or new ones coming) that try to address this or similar chronic issues for children and adults are catering to top 2-3 % of the population. And even they have low success rate in reversing or managing this via lifestyle interventions. Even if we consider an aggressive 50% success rate and assume they cater to 5% of the population data, at best we can expect a 2.5 % improvement. \n\nThe unhealthy snack alternatives cost 5-10 X and have limited distribution. \n\nThe diabetes monitoring, trackers, lifestyle solutions cost over 30K per year (metformin and statins costs around 3-5K per year) \n\nWhen one buys a \"so called\" unhealthy snack they are not buying food, they are buying convenience (in fact convenience was the marketing positioning of this in the 60s and 70s when packaged industry started along with women liberation) ... But the so called healthy snacks now are also not selling food - they are also selling convenience. Why does one need to spend 150 Rs on a protein bar or shake when one can get that much protein from milk, eggs, paneer at 1/5th of the cost - because the bar is convenient. \n\nIMHO - the one and only thing that can create a lasting and wide impact is awareness and education.

      "Dilip, could the growing mental pressure on kids also be contributing to obesity? With high expectations from elders, children are pushed to excel not just in academics but in multiple activities like robotics, tennis, and swimming—all at once. This stress, along with a lack of free play and relaxation, might lead to emotional eating and a sedentary lifestyle, increasing obesity risks.",
      "It coincides with Modi-led BJP's rise to power.",
      "I think in age of technology and plenty of options kids these days have pushed physical activity on a very low priority. They are able to spend hours on Instagram but do not want to spend minutes on exercise or sport. In India we should consider law like Australia has done recently of banning social media for children below 16. Sweden is now investing €104 million to bring back printed textbooks. Although these initiatives may not be intended to increase physical activity but this will definitely play role in increasing physical activity. Also certain developments like bone density , growth can happen till certain age and poor health habits in children means one will pay for next 70-80 years ",

Inclusion of millets in diet and fruits of every kind according to season. Encourage my child to do physical stuff more and he loves doing it. Children's habits start from a very young age. If you teach them bad stuff they will adopt bad stuff and if you teach them good stuff they will adopt good stuff. Starting years are building blocks of habits of children. Nobody should ignore it.",

      "Absolutely on point! 💯 Just adding one more thought… don’t just tell them what to do, show them. \n\nBe the example they look up to. We can’t expect our kids to develop healthy habits if we’re staying up late binge-watching Netflix, skipping exercise, and living a sedentary lifestyle. \n\nKids don’t follow instructions, they imitate actions!

      "I do not agree to all the posts that Dilip Kumar shares. But this is a post that I can get behind.\n1. Don’t outsource their health to the system: No app/ ring/ band/ gym course is going to get you moving more consciously and consistently than your brain.\n2. Play & sports is nature’s way of making kids fit: There is no right or wrong way to play a sport that makes the child happy. Parents who want to make professional sportsperson from their kids miss the point.\n3. Parents think kids should ‘want’ to exercise or eat well:  Specification by example works best. As a parent you set wrong example every time you order 10 minute food delivery for your cravings and skip your workout for a binge watch of Netflix\n4. The mainstream food industry is a trap: It includes all protein fortified, antioxidant, vitamin enriched food that gets advertised and shared. They are in to business for making money not making people healthy!\nIt is always individuals choice And it is always hard to choose right.",

      "Kids even very young ones don't listen to their parents anymore. The single child of working parents knows that he has to throw just one tantrum and everyone will be at his feet. \nSecondly huge amount of research goes into design, packaging and taste of processed food so that they are attractive to the kids. Home cooked food's battle with them is grossly one-sided. \nNo wonder we see such results. Apart from wringing our hands we can do little else. ",

And for me it is always followed by regret the next day when I wake up with a painful hangover. \n\nAlcohol is expensive, the after-effects are awful no matter the quantity, and many of us have seen how badly it screws up people's health. We observe older folks who are now experiencing the effects of long-term drinking.\n\nMind you, I love catching up over a beer but many times I simply say no because it's a working day the next day. \n\nPS: although alcohol consumption might be decreasing, I feel cigarette smoking is going up (anecdotal evidence). Not many people I know from my grandparents/parents' generation smoke, but I have observed almost everyone from my circle (Gen Z) smoke at least socially.",
      "Hi Dilip Kumar, thank you for sharing this data and for the incredible work you’ve been doing in healthcare investing—it’s truly inspiring!\nThat said, I wanted to share a thought on the data. It seems this information was collected pre-COVID, with the last batch being from 2019, which means it’s over four years old. Additionally, since the research was conducted by the MOHFW's Family Health Survey Team, I wonder if it focused predominantly on rural populations. Even if urban areas were included, it’s possible the survey might not have accounted for the elite and affluent segments who often consume alcohol on regular occasions.\nWhile the data provides an interesting perspective, I feel recency and relevancy are critical to forming accurate conclusions, especially in current times. This is by no means a critique of your post—I truly admire the insights you bring to the table. Just sharing my thoughts. ",

      "It's great to learn and see healthcare startups coming up to solve health related problems.\n\nHowever,  a dark side of healthcare startups is growing everyday.\n\nOne of the key aspects of healthcare is Patient Privacy and Patient data safety. Startups today are openly flouting the regulations by sourcing patient data (read potential customers) by illegitimate means.\n\nThey know about patient history, pan, aadhar details, payments made.\n\nThen they push down complex treatments and surgeries down your throat as Candies.\n\nSuch low is the level they are bringing the healthcare down to. (Not that it was great anyway) but most doctors had humanity,  compassion and intent to help patients.\n\nOn the contrary, these startups are turning into commercial engines to please their bosses and investors with no regard and empathy to patient conditions.\n\nI hope and wish you succeed as an investor with an empathetic approach towards end users (patients) and guide/educate your portfolio companies about importance of patient data safety, integrity.\n\nBest wishes.",

      "Dilip Kumar Your commitment to addressing India’s healthcare challenges through entrepreneurial innovation is truly commendable! Investing in 35+ companies within such a short span is a testament to your belief in the power of startups to drive meaningful change.\n\nThe decision to open source your learnings and observations is a game-changer—it not only fosters collaboration but also empowers budding entrepreneurs to refine their ideas and approaches.\n\nCould you share a sneak peek into some of the key trends or solutions you’ve observed in these startups? It would be inspiring for others looking to make a similar impact in the healthcare space!",

Authentic connections matter in this space.\n\n3. Pitching to Patient Investors\nApproach investors who understand your space and are willing to grow with you over the long term.

Collaboration and partnerships are essential to create lasting impact and scale effectively.",

      "Valid point!",
      "Totally agreed… so true!!!",
      "Interesting",
      "True Dilip Kumar \nAttention a child want should be “undivided attention” only. Sometimes giving as less as half an hour to one hour attention ,but undivided attention is sufficient to make them feel secure and loved by parents.",
      "Well said! We have to take care of our health; then only we can take care of our family and our responsibilities!",
      "Well said Dilip",
      "Oh I can totally relate to this. I got a daughter who thinks the same way😂",
      "Dilip, my appreciation for parents who are conscious of their health has grown manifold since my father passed away. Kudos to you for acknowledging your own limitations and mortality.",
      "Love this, Dilip Kumar. Parenting unfolds as a poignant journey through boundless love and sheer resilience, where each day is a fresh challenge that tests our limits yet enriches our lives beyond measure. ",
      "The Young Dads (and Moms) who work with me aren't chasing a 6-pack. They want the ability (and energy) to play with their child without saying no.\n\nThese are the golden years.\n\nDilip Kumar",
      "You have articulated what was in my heart last evening - WORD for WORD! \n\nThe reason my workouts are sacrosanct - so I can kill it in every other aspect of life! ",
      "Absolutely!  Staying healthy is the foundation that lets us show up for our loved ones, no matter what the day brings.",
      "staying healthy is the most ignored aspect of life.... people spend thousands on buying material but not on gym, yoga membership.  Always hire coaches if you can afford to keep you in optimal fitness level..... its important, I travel by metro to work for 1hr 30 mins one side, i see people struggliong to keep standing, they lean all over the roads/ pillars, which is directly proportional to yopur health parameters\n",
      "Can't agree more! It's the kids who radiate more energy, they inspire us a lot!",
      "Love this piece !\nAs a father of 11m old daughter, I am trying to draw inspiration to workout to be an inspiration for my kiddo in coming future !",
      "i think the best gift we can give our kids is the time they deserve. sometimes we tend to indulge so much in career making that we forget the fact that their childhood is never coming back and so is our time with them and our chance to re-live the childhood. Being a parent myself I have started prioritizing my health than any thing else.",
      "Some relationships are beyond ratings. These can heal and rejuvenate more than tax or drain. \n\nIf I were to rewind 3 decades, a child can be the perfect panacea for a trying day, still is.",
      "Health and fitness are important not just for ourselves- but for being present and engaged with the family.",
      "Cant agree more!! Good one Dilip Kumar",
      "Just my experience; could be different for others! But on days I exercise consciously (not walk to the grocery store, etc) are also the days where I have more energy to play with my 2 year old.\n\nOther days, lethargy creeps in. \n\nJust like the adage ‘money makes money’ it’s almost like ‘energy makes energy’.",
      "Agreed a 100%.  Getting fit and healthy is the only way out. \nThe type of programs that need to be done by parents to stay healthy and fit is quite different from the traditional S&C, HIIT , weight loss driven programs. \n\nTransformation.Studio:   We're experimenting with programming for parents specifically. Focussing on foundations more than high performance. \nWith dipping energy levels, parents need workouts and nutrition that improve recovery and help them get the most out of their days.   \n\nCurious to see/learn how parents stay fit, especially the ones who are starting from a low baseline level of fitness.",
      "True. Balancing career ambitions with family time is no easy feat. At 49, with two young boys (ages 6 and 4) eagerly waiting for dad time after office hours, I often feel the tug-of-war between being a committed employee and a present parent. I'm learning that, sometimes, quality beats quantity. Even a brief 15-minute story time or a short play session, with no phone or distractions, can go a long way in creating those special memories. 💙",
      "I can’t emphasize this enough—my husband and I often find ourselves in deep conversations about how we can live healthier and more mindful lives.",
      "This is so identifiable!! Health is your true wealth and all the more important when you have to balance work with kids and family!",
      "Your fitness and health routines aren’t just for you, they’re so you can keep up, be present, and bring best to you family. ",
      "I agree so wholeheartedly. 6 months ago I felt this so acutely. \n\nWhen you are not fit or healthy. It has so much spillover on so many aspects of your life. \n\nI have literally spent the last 6 months carving a fitter self (mentally and physically) so that I am a capable parent, partner, employee, boss..\n\nLost 30kgs, started therapy, going regularly to the gym. Learned some lifelong skills w.r.t food, fixed sleep, started meditation. Focused on building extendable rhythms than habits.\n\nI literally feel like a different human being and my kids can most definitely tell that I enjoy spending time with them and not doing it to check off a box.\n\nIt is 1 million % worth it.",
      "As a toddler parent, couldn't agree more. Apart from being fit and present, what also really makes the parenthood journey smoother is understanding your child and their development journey - something we are building for all first time parents with Sitaara.",
      "And for staying healthy we dont need any tech/apps, health is the only area in human development that had degraded over time (barring the longevity), which means people were more healthier in earlier days. So tech cannot solve for staying fit to a large extent",
      "And no matter how tired you are, that beaming grin, that hug, that smile is worth it because it keeps you focussed on the things that really matter.",
      "Valid point . The best linkedin decision I took was to follow you. Many of the mid aged professionals face this challenge. After all it's our kids well being we are toiling so hard.",
      "It’s true, parenting is like an endurance race—you're exhausted, but the finish line is worth every step. Just remember, even a champion needs to recharge!",
      "Totally agree, just been realizing this more and more recently. It's directly proportional.",
      "Totally agree Dilipji the only way to get out of this mayhem",
      "Absolutely, like Mother Teresa said, if you want to make a change in the world, go back home and love your family!",
      "Not sure how old your child is now Dilip. \n\nBut guess how underrated is to be a teen. Come home to a parent who has no clue how demanding the teachers are. How long the test was. How tiring the PE class was. How many periods they ahve to attend. All that the parents expect is for the smile, act jolly, cuddle up and act as if they have the perfect day at school everyday!!\n\nYou still muster your courage and try not reflect all this and when your dad asks you how was your day, you muster up the courage to say 'fine' and a half smile, keen to get on with the dinner.\n\n😁 ",
      "I think this is the best post I have seen for motivating people towards fitness and staying healthy 😀 ",
      "Yeahh Dilip Kumar  , have that incredible way of putting everything into perspective—no status updates, no deadlines, just pure presence.\n\n       and you’re spot on about staying fit; it’s the real game-changer in being able to show up day after day for the people who matter most.\n\nDo you have a favorite way to recharge after a long day?\n Always looking to hear what keeps high-energy people like you balanced and grounded",
      "For me health = Energy. The more the energy and zest for life, the more you can give time for others. :)\n",
      "I resonate with this. \nThis is also something I like to remind people when talking about the importance and the WHY for making time and effort to move and stay healthy. \nTaking good care of yourself is the best thing you can do for your loved ones. You are replaceable at work but not for your family.  ",
      "Literally took a screenshot of this to send on my family group, been after my parents specially my mom going through menopause and dipped estrogen to start yoga for better mental health reduced irritation and hot flashes. The only way is leading by example.",
      "Wrote an article on this : \nhttps://excuselesslife.substack.com/p/8-mins-guide-for-parents-parents?r=2jd4f",
      "After my workI play cricket with kids in #Adelaide:) yes Physical and Mental health is most important"

      "Dilip Kumar, thanks for sharing an interesting perspective on real work. Most of us are at different stages of evolution at workplace, so our perspective about real work differs and it differs for their own good and not so good reasons. \n\nSo, keen to know from you how we can make this transition to more meaningful and high impact work as an entrepreneur and as a stakeholder in a Corp world? ",
      "What's the alternative to these?",
      "Real work includes the work you don't like doing - such as how to develop the negotiation skills to avoid unproductive meetings. ",
      "Meetings are sometimes really not called for that can be sorted over just a call. ",
      "On top of that most will say - we are a outcome driven company!",
      "Human beings do not have time to cultivate self-esteem. So they put a bandage on it by calling everyone and having meetings, to \"appear\" important. ",
      "Most of meetings I have attended,\n\nIt felt like it were planned to show productivity of leaders. No outcomes, no agenda only formalities. \n\nIf we start asking what will be impact/ outcome of meetings, most of meetings would get cancelled.",

      "As a doctor and now a founder of preventive healthcare company , I’d say though the preventive care is the way to go but the adoption currently is very limited . There’s a need to educate and make the patients / customers see value in shifting the focus from reactive to proactive care !",
      "Empower is also the leadership characteristic instead of instructions empowering can give path to new idea's, different ways, thinking to get things done.",
      "Totally agreed, Dilip!\n\nThere’s a growing need for preventive healthcare, and we’re building exactly that at Even. Often, our initial conversations with potential members require a lot of convincing and evidence that preventive healthcare is the way to go. People are accustomed to the traditional health cover model, which only pays for bills; so our features—like free doctor consultations, tests, and specialist visits—can seem too good to be true.\n\nThat said, there’s also been a progressive shift in healthcare conversations recently, which is a promising sign that companies building healthcare slowly and steadily are on the right track. 🎈",
      "Love this! This is the essence of what we are and here is what has happened in the process!\n\nFocus is on preventing disease by optimising nutrition and lifestyle - and the body has treated its own ailments, as it is given the right foundation\n\nWe engage - gamefied the product so that users are driven to use the platform and thereby have benefitted\n\nProve - it has taken us 8 years - the body not a hardware product where testing cycles are just another bug fix\n\nEmpower - life happens, we give you the tools that is best for you\n\nSimplify - Science is heavy, we translate it to actionables. 20% of the interventions can bring about 80% improvements. We pick the interventions that give the best results (based on peer reviewed science and out own data)\n\nCheck us out at sr.tn or feel free to reach out to me directly if you want to join or know more about the program!",
      "I'm sure every non-clinical founder thought 🤔 whether they are working on prevention or treatments, after reading this first line",
      "Great advice for healthcare entrepreneurs! \n\nAnother key is to prioritize patient-centered care and focus on improving outcomes, not just profits. ",
      "We at Roojh Health do agree and have built solutions empowering doctors and patients who constitute the basic unit of healthcare.                But India has long way to go to build a mature healthcare system which parallels advanced countries and which works for all patients. e.g. patients health awareness/education is low, doctors resist digitization. It will take a village.",
      "Insightful",
      "So true Dilip.    If I may add one more:\n\nListen, don’t preach, then react.\n\nEngaging with your clients/patients must be a conversation, not a monologue.\n\nThey will tell you their needs and how to fix them.\n\nThank you for you post!",
      "Shifting from treating to preventive care would be a game changer",
      "Great advice",
      "This is on point Dilip Kumar :)",
      "Also 3D print Human parts first and the world has to get together to test them asap to benefit mankind.\n\nI guess Dilip also a united front across all nations is required because the idiot friendly super power and obamacare also has unfortunately damaged mankind more than helped.",
      "15 words, but a whole new mindset! Dilip Kumar",
      "Very well said Nivesh Khandelwal",
      "What you see is oartly and mostly due to the patients themselves demanding a treatment, a doc that does not prescribe a med is considered to be out of this world.\nAnd so the ship chugs along.\nAnd as someone has rightly said in your post line that let humans be humans…. \nEat drink make merry ofcourse in moderation and as per individual appetite after all it is one life",
      "Great insights! I would also add that personalized healthcare is the way forward.  ",
      "Dilip Kumar Excellent principles! Focusing on prevention, engagement, empowerment, and simplicity is key to driving real change in healthcare. Proving value through action rather than promises is how impactful brands will stand out.",
      "Engage, don’t shout\nProve, don’t promise\nEmpower, don’t instruct\nSimplify, don’t complicate\n\nThis sounds like something all founders should do 😊",
      "Sir please consider rural India were 75 percentage population live",
      "Dilip Kumar \n\nThe current healthcare market in India has long been reactive, centered around treatment rather than prevention, a strategy that has become outdated.\n\nGiants like Apollo and Fortis have traditionally focused on curative care, but the future demands a strategic pivot. Startups like Curefit - house of cult and HealthifyMe App  are ahead of the curve, building their entire model around prevention, user engagement, and holistic wellness, which is proving to be more sustainable in the long run.\n\nThe shift to \"prove, not promise\" is key to long-term success. Practo’s user-review strategy exemplifies how validation and trust can become a competitive advantage.\n\nAs the healthcare landscape evolves, companies that adopt preventive care, empower users with knowledge, and offer simplified, user-friendly experiences will truly stand out.\n\nStrategically, this isn't just a trend, it's a survival strategy for the future of healthcare.\n\nWorth thinking about!",
      "Absolutely agree. Prevention is key, and engagement is crucial Dilip",
      "Better, don't worse. Thanks for summing this Dilip Kumar",
      "So true. How about we look at sports as a way to show people that you can get healthier by actually playing some sport regularly, if gym isnt a thing? The sport could be running, badminton, run or maybe the latest craze in town - pickleball! ",
      "Well said! 👏🏽",
      "Love this, Dilip Kumar!\n\n1. Prevent, don't treat– Tech like wearables and AI make prevention easier and actionable.\n\n2. Engage, don't shout– Personalize care through real conversations, not sales talk.\n\n3. Empower, don't instruct– Simple, clear education builds trust and confidence.\n\n4. Simplify, don't complicate– Keep tech intuitive so patients and providers focus on health, not complexity.\n\n5. Prove, don't promise – Show real-world results. Data and trials speak louder than marketing.\n\nThis aligns perfectly with the direction healthcare needs to take—thanks for sharing!",
      "At Prevealth, we also believe the same- The future lies in the Preventive Healthcare. However, it requires a lot of attention on the human element. While prevention is better than the cure, a push is needed to change the mindset of people from reactive to preventive healthcare. \nAny suggestions on how to work on this?  ",
      " Focusing on prevention, engagement, and empowerment is key in building trust and delivering real value. Simplifying the journey to better health ensures that users aren’t overwhelmed but feel supported, while proving your claims solidifies your credibility in a space that thrives on evidence. ",
      "This is so needed. The healthcare system needs to change and focus on simplifying processes and preventive care. Dilip Kumar",
      "Healthcare entrepreneurs and builders, here are my 15 words for you:\n\nBalance, don’t oversimplify \nInform, don’t preach \nAdapt, don’t rigidify \nValidate, don’t exaggerate \nEngage, don’t ignore\n\nWill elaborate:\n\nBalance, don’t oversimplify – Find the right mix of prevention and treatment, complexity and simplicity. \nInform, don’t preach – Provide knowledge and structure, not just one or the other. \nAdapt, don’t rigidify – Be flexible and responsive to the ever-changing landscape of healthcare. \nValidate, don’t exaggerate – Back up your claims with evidence, but don't forget the importance of marketing. \nEngage, don’t ignore – Build meaningful conversations, but also convert that engagement into action. Dilip Kumar",
      "Love this 👌",
      "No one is apparently talking about preventive mouthcare, recently followed few dental hygienists _ in India no one is working well on prescriptive hygiene such a big gap in dental healthcare, which definitely affects your overall gut and digestive health.",
      "Well said Dilip Kumar",
      "Preventive healthcare, in its current form, will always fail. No stakeholder in the ecosystem is incentivised to prevent. This includes patients. The TG for preventive healthcare is very very small.  \n\nThe problem with Wellness/Preventive healthcare is that it sucks out all joy from life ! Wake up at 4 am, workout , eat salads, dont drink, dont smoke, sleep early etc etc. \n\nFrankly, what's the point of an endless endeavour to prolong a joyless life :-). \n\nWhat will work is an Early Detection platform that allows humans to have some bad habits and lets them know when they need to tone down. Let humans be humans !",
      "100% agree on it. ",
      "This is a fantastic philosophy, Dilip Kumar! I completely resonate with the emphasis on preventive care and building meaningful conversations in the healthcare industry. ",
      "This was beautiful. Needs to be said more.",
      "Specific yet Generic 👏👏👏\n\nI wonder where these Entrepreneurs, Builders are. And more importantly where such Investors are.",
      "Great advice—actions and results always speak louder than words!",
      "Dilip great and much needed insights. And this is not limited to the healthcare industry, it should be applicable to all other industries as well for a sustainable future",
      "“Trying is Always better than False Perception and then Assumptions and ultimately Prediction”😉\n\nThanks for pointing out this meaningful post everyday with the alignment Dilip Kumar 🫡",
      "Dilip Kumar Nowadays some Genz are getting influence by the Influeners whose perception getting  changed Day by Day😅\nAt least people who are simplifying things we should appreciate them 🫡\n\nBecause rather then being in false influencing they are trying to “You know Marketing” Something Meaningful 🤗"

    "text": "Have met over 600+ healthcare startups this year at Rainmatter. These are my general observations of the sector in 2024 so far. An investor & health enthusiast perspective. \n\nRemember, these are observations and not opinions.  If you’re a builder, I'm always keen to exchange notes.\n\n1) Health tech needs maturing – The novelty phase of tech meets health is over and the focus should be on driving outcomes to the user.\n\n2) Preventive health is gaining traction – More startups are focused on preventive solutions.\n\n3) Nutrition personalisation is heating up – Companies are going beyond generic consulting and leveraging DNA, microbiome, or other personal data for nutrition recommendations.\n\n4) UPI for health not yet in India- ABDM use cases haven't seen much adoption.\n\n5) Wearables are no longer the star – Smartwatches and rings are still strong but are considered table stakes. Consumers want something that tells “why” and not limited to “what”.\n\n6) Corporate wellness is an overrated market – With rising mental health issues, stress, and burnout in the workforce, B2B wellness solutions ideally should show promise. But there isn’t adoption from corporates.\n\n7) The “biohacking” trend is niche but growing –longevity startups are speculative but hot.  Increasing interest in biohacking protocols (sleep optimization, anti ageing etc.). But the market is niche and often hard to validate scientifically unless clinical protocols are done.\n\n8) Consumer trust in health supplements is dwindling – The supplement industry lacks regulation and transparency and this has eroded trust amongst consumers. Brands are focusing on science-backed products.\n\n9) AI in healthcare – Many are bullish on AI’s potential to revolutionise diagnostics, patient care, and drug discovery, but deployment in clinical settings is slow and capital-intensive.\n\n10) Mental health is booming – Digital mental health startups, especially those offering therapy, coaching, or CBT solutions are seeing adoptions but differentiation is becoming a challenge in a crowded market.\n\n11) Community-driven fitness – Social, community-oriented fitness solutions still have potential if done right especially those blending real-world interactions with digital offerings.\n\n12) CAC is a challenge for D2C health brands – Brands are facing rising customer acquisition costs often with no sustainable GTM.\n\n13) Hybrid health businesses are scaling better – Companies combining digital and physical services have better scope of scaling fast.\n\n14) Telehealth plateaued – The initial excitement around telehealth has subsided for both consumers and investors.\n\n15) Health marketplaces have no moat – Platforms connecting consumers with healthcare providers or wellness services are overrated with no clear moat to grow.\n\nThere are more thoughts on this.

I understand there’s a perceived risk, but not addressing the critical gap in emergency care feels even riskier.

      "Very well summarized Dilip. Hoping to get an opportunity to connect next time",
      "Very insightful. Point 11 and 23 (it’s in extended part over Twitter) are something which every healthcare service provider needs to look at. It’s fundamental. You can’t have product or services without people and best way to reach out and stay out there is via community. It’s been happening for ages. Community had been best channel for success of any product as there is peer endorsements and group commitment over the usage as well as utility of the product. Correction and pivoting is easier and the marketing efforts are as good as explaining it to bunch of people and once they are convinced they carry the information just like bees spreading the pollen grain which then grows where ever it drops. Unfortunately even the leaders driving community marketing aren’t able to stay focused till the other end of tunnel. It’s a hercualian task to drive through the lane of community marketing where you deal with real people and real reaction. Building a relatable product, adaptable and understandable content is key because something which cannot be communicated cannot be consumed. Likewise corporate marketing is also driven by what we have rather than what they want. Product are built in isolation & expected to be adapted in crowd. Cheers",
      "I think we need more deeptech in biomedical healtcare space, also some patented reasearch will have strong moat. Robotics +AI in healthcare will be the future. Some intresting examples \n\n1) MRI +CT scan or any laboratory technologist robots\n2) Disease detection models\n3) Cancer prediction models\n4) Robotics Surgery technology",
      "The biggest problem is that people think a product, device or measurement is going to (somehow) result in, or lead to, good health.\n\nHow many wearables are sold in those Blue Zones??\n\nI suppose, it can be a starting point on that journey.\n\nBut, in my experience, it is far more of an \"internal\" journey.\n\nThere are 2 key requirements - Mindset Change and Physical Activity.\n\nWithout these, its all just noise!\n\nGranted that some devices can be indirect motivators via gamification and stuff...but, without the mindset shift/development, that novelty wears off when that initial motivation fades.\n\nConsistency is the key...and that requires a strong mindset.\n\nConsistency doesn't need a wearable...it needs discipline! 😀 ",
      "Insightful... Current clinical advancements are mere tech/AI advancements due to tech growth, and that too in Clinical admin/procedural workflows automation. \nReal patient-care AI is needed in screening/diag/treatment efficiency, which requires deep-domain understanding (by tech) & adoption (by medical).\n\nAn inter-disciplinary mindset is the need. Its time for tech/medical academia to reform themselves for better future and co-existence",
      "Love this",
      "Insightful !Dilip Kumar ",
      "Very informative Dilip Kumar \n\nwhat segment of population (child, eldercare middle aged men and women) have you seen most traction towards w.r.t D2C healthcare startups? And which consumer segment  is the most ignored? - is this approach even valid(building specifically for a demographic segment)?\n\nAlso difficulties in clinical adoption of newer technologies stem in large part due to doctors being uncomfortable with anything but the age old pen and pad system. In light of that, does medical education and training have potential too such that we are able to create a generation of clinicians that are aware and equipped to embrace further automation amongst other changes in the medical landscape?",
      "Hi dileep ,about point 9,the entire exercise of AI into health should be slow because we are dealing with lives here,slow will ensure more accuracy",
      "Very informative",
      "Nice one, I think the hierarchy of points is also well set.",

      "Dilip Kumar Thanks for sharing - super interesting! It’d be grateful if you could point me to startups in preventive healthcare :)",
      "Interesting. One point that could be added...The industry has 3 legs... Diagnostics, Med Dev and Health/care tech... interesting the way the world operates in each of the three legs is very different from the other and hence many assumptions would fail (if intrinsic domain knowledge is not properly accounted for)...and that is hellish difficult to understand as well make someone else understand.",
      "Hi Dilip, \nFor point 4, I believe that the adoption of ABDM is slow because the Indian healthcare system primarily relies on server-based software, which limits the interoperability of medical data. \n\nThis, in turn, hinders technological advancements in practice. While we live in an era where AI can predict conditions like lung cancer, India is still transitioning from server-based systems to cloud computing.\n\nMy thesis is that SaaS companies in healthcare have significant growth potential, as we now possess cutting-edge technology to create products for a market that is about 10 years behind in terms of technology adoption.",

      "Agree with the overall assessment of Indian healthcare startup where the real impactful\nInnovations are lacking.  \n\nWhat next? As a doctor after going through differential diagnosis we confirm our diagnosis and build a management plan. \n\nOne way forward is personalized healthcare solutions which require streamlined, longitudinal digital health information, contrast with current paper based information. This is hard and no good revenue model. But has to happen.",

      "My takeaway from you post on potential winners:\n1. AI in healthcare with clinical validation \n2. Mental health companies with stellar products \n3. Nutrition and D2C with quality products would win. \n\nAlthough I feel that all of the above are winners in any market, if you want to build a quality product in the above 3, build for a market that has 30-40x per capita income (read US)\n\nIMO the following would win in Indian healthcare: \n1. Solution for payers and out of pocket expenses (simplification needed) \n2. Health infra companies building single specialty (AI and tech enabled) chains  \n3. Low cost patient education - powered by AI - value derived from govt and pharma \n4. AI powered diagnostic screening for masses - value derived from pharma and public health agencies.",
      "Well summarized. Thanks for sharing. \n Though Healthcare Mgmt presents a large market with Payer, Providers and Wellness alluding at large TAMs, in reality LTV and CAC present a contrasting picture. \nMeanwhile MedTech,  Dx, Lifesciences,  LabTech, AI in Dx, Tx, Pharma all present strong use cases with MM$ opportunities but most investors lack patience,  core competency to understand nuances and appetite for LT RoI.\n\nHealthcare investment in India can't be a mirror of US/ Developed market Startups. It's not fintech, ecommerce equivalent for sure.",

Our platform promotes health through interactive data and AI-driven features, making court booking and game management seamless. It’s all about convenience and keeping players engaged and healthy. \n\nThis tech-driven approach to fitness is where we see the future heading—combining sport, health, and seamless engagement",
      "This is very insightful",
      "Completely agree. Very interesting insights. Find this one of the most interesting sectors but most challenging to build consumer trust especially in trust deficit market such as India. Also don’t think preventive is still that big besides tests and that could be cultural reason of us still being Kay sera sera.",
      "Spot on dilipji All are products are validated through food scientists and nutritionist from GOI now we have been approached by top 2 medical institutes for clinical studies .Retention is our top priority.",
      "The first and the foremost is the main important observation - Driving outcomes to the user. More than efforts of various healthcare startups, its the results which are important with strong ROI of atleast 15x to hospitals / clinics / doctors. \n\nAny healthcare startup should improve measurable customer experience (to increase repeat footfalls, loyalty, increased patient LTV, etc) or exponentially & sustainably grow hospital / clinic revenues (not incremental revenue growth, incremental growth even an intern can do) or drive their costs drastically down to improve their profitability\n",
      "Aravind G Dhanushya Sree",
      "Absolutely right Dilip Kumar",
      "This was great! Thanks for sharing these insights. It's easy to understand what's working and what's not in this segment.",
      "Rahil Shah",
      "We are filling the gap of quality  instruments particularly imported ones are much cheaper rates compared to MNCs in NE region. Is there a probability of raising fund from Rainmatter",
      "If you’re building a AI first health tech, we would love to know !",
      "Rishi Nagar",
      "Wow ! Profound and very insightful! :)",
      "Vidhatri Subramanyam Bengaluru",
      "Love this in depth analysis Dilip Kumar , thanks for sharing your insights !",
      "Have you noticed a shift towards personalized wellness experiences?\n\nBespoke solutions to individual needs could be the next big trend!",
      "Personally working on no 11, would you be willing to double click on it and exchange more notes 🗒️ ",
      "Very informative feedback, appreciate you shared this Dilip Kumar. We are building in this field and from your feedback are very aligned with your thesis. I can almost take each point and tell you how we plan to counter / answer them. But maybe we can take this offline 😜.",
      "Kunal Kishore , Anubha Prasad , Manish Pathak , Divyanshu Verma .. good insights for our health investment thesis at Karekeba Ventures",
      "Dilip Kumar very interesting perspective. I must say your observation on each segment is really useful for many entrepreneurs and could help them build or change the way they are building healthcare startups .",
      "Hi Dilip Kumar we are also building in the AI for Healthcare space for Neurosciences. Would love to get on a call with you. ",
      "Interesting",
      "I don’t see any actionable products from healthcare startups in the Rainmatter Fund, or for that matter, in most incubation centers.\n\nActionable outcomes backed by clinical evidence are key.\nThe Indian consumer, unlike some in the West, has an aversion to overly verbose wellness screens, marketplaces, or products like vanilla sequencing tests, and worst of all nutraceuticals like probiotics (on the Indian market with 0 research or evidence) that offer no clear impact. \n\nUnfortunately, it is impossible for most amateurs to build serious, actionable bio/health/agri-tech products as this requires deep expertise.",
      "Dilip Kumar 1000% agree on both points regarding clinical validation. The process ( if done honestly and ethically) literally takes the life out you in terms of money, patience and energy, but it is the only way to be responsible towards patients, especially when you are trying to unseat and call out the off label use incumbent chaps.\n\nOn another note, was expecting you to write a bit on womens’ health. Havent met too many of those?",
      "Thanks for compiling the summary. Very useful for early stage founders like me. It would be great if Rainmatter organize a health and wellness conference. It would provide a networking & collaboration opportunity for all the early stage founders in health, wellness and fitness domains.",
      "Would love more insights on sports :) already taken note of the physical is here to stay and community building aspect. Thank you",
      "Dilip Kumar - On point 9th, on AI in healthcare, even though deployment in clinical settings is slow and capital-intensive (mostly expected), do you see any of them building a moat in long-term and AI helping increasing scalability?",

It's clear that people value moments that evoke deep emotions and create lasting memories.\n\nThese are the experiences that resonate on a personal level, beyond material goods, and they’re willing to invest in them because they enrich their lives in a meaningful way.",

      "Spot on ",
      "I am equally surprised to see kids talking about mental health more and openly which is how it should be.",
      "Completely agree! In today's fast-paced world, we often neglect our emotions, leading to issues that hinder our potential. It's essential to prioritise ourselves for a happier and stress-free life.",
      "The definition of wealth is certainly evolving.",
      "This is so true! Health is the real wealth, and it's amazing to see younger generations prioritizing mental and physical well-being. Success is meaningless without the ability to enjoy it. Longevity and quality of life should be at the heart of every goal! 🙂 ",
      "That is the age-old saying: 'health is wealth.' Being healthy becomes easier once you realize that your health is solely your responsibility.",
      "Valid point",
      "For the first time in two decades this situation has become as critical as it is today.. its important that the realisation cones from within, as it's hard for someone else to make them realise.",
      "Great!! And completely agreeing upon this👍",
      "Can't agree more! Health is the most underrated investment. If we can just treat our workout routine like SIP fund; automate one-hour everyday for a workout; we're set for lifelong great returns! And yes those quick walks and mindful meals become second nature (your daily dividends :P) Good to know next gen is not just focusing on financial portfolios but body & mind capital too!",
      "Akash S. ",
      "Valid point",
      "Very true !",
      "Fully agreed.\n\nVery  essential to focus on healthy life style..\n\nUnfortunately we learn these things late 30s.\n\nThanks for sharing your thoughts\n",
      "Absolutely! well said Dilip Kumar. Additionally it requires a complete overhaul of working culture in India to improve the situation which can be achieved only by introducing a law which is strictly implemented. \nIts high time GOI starts to acknowledge the contribution of the working class in building the country through their hard work and tax money that they are forced to Pay. Otherwise such outrage will also fizzle out with outcry limited on social media. :(",
      "It’s about finding harmony between work and wellness, so you can truly enjoy the fruits of your labor and live a fulfilling life.",
      "very true",
      "Health comes first! ",
      "So true! Health is the real wealth we should cherish.",
      "Satya vachan",
      "True wealth encompasses the ability to enjoy life fully—taking a walk, savoring meals, and disconnecting from work. Dilip Kumar \n\nNo amount of financial success can replace the value of well-being.",
      "Being able to take a deep breath in and out without stress is the greatest wealth we have",
      "Valid point!\n\nWhile mental and physical well-being should be important, and youth should prioritize it, you will always find that the youths who look for this are from financially stable backgrounds with parents to fall back to! The other half of youths who had to work harder to reach this point, with modest to low-income backgrounds, and with family responsibilities have to have a continuous flow of income and cannot afford to find and choose working conditions on one’s own choices. To attain the “wealthiness” you mention, some youths generally reach the freedom after 30s which is not wrong but just fact.\n\nMost MNCs have sales persons in foreign countries who pitch and sell Indian workforce as cheap labours who can work more hours. This needs to change otherwise the wellness mentality will never set in.",
      "Agreed. People like me set the tone 20+ years ago by buying into the glamour of the long hours and the hustle, often adapting beliefs of others ahead of us / other geographies. We might find it harder to see what the 20 somethings are doing as actually needing courage, but that distance is for us to cover. I wouldn't have had the space to say I am prioritising my well-being in my 20s. When I now see gym bags at work / bicycles at the parking lot / conversations on training runs, I applaud their efforts to make good health into a habit.   ",
      "Great point here, love how you've highlighted the value of health over material success. It's true—unhealthy habits sneak up on you over time. Many workplaces preach work-life balance, but then they load up on back-to-back meetings and unrealistic deadlines. If a company really wants its people to thrive, it's gotta make room for personal growth, time off, and, well, just living. \n\nHaving systems in place for employees to prioritize health isn't just a nice-to-have, it's essential. Plus, when employees know they're supported in their wellness, they tend to perform way better. It's time companies walk the talk on wellness.",
      "Prioritizing health over wealth is a powerful shift. True success isn’t just financial, it’s about enjoying life without compromise.",
      "Waiting for more people to become micro and nano entrepreneurs, moving to non urbanized centres, living minimal lives and letting go of toxic and overworked lives and jobs. All so that - we can just become a less 'frustrated, on the edge, dopamine-chasing' species /country at least",
      "Well said !",
      "So true! It’s just empty and sad. So glad this generation doesn’t want this for themselves.",
      "I can totally relate. I’m 26 now, my 24 year old self wouldn’t have imagined that I would be prioritising my health and go on to help others build habits for good health. \n\nFor me a high quality of life is one where I am eating high quality food, able to move and do challenging sports, learn new skills and do a job that impacts people’s lives in a meaningful way.",
      "Unless you are a founder or working on your multiple businesses (not justified even then but understandable), you shouldn't be having any excuses for not being able to take time out for a little workout. ",
      "A health and emotionally stable individual can definitely become a pathbreaking entrepreneur or inventor or wealthy person. The only issue is that media and world does not romanticize successful people, who are healthy, prioritize themselves n mentally sound.",
      "It's high time we dive deep to the very core of ourselves rather than just relentlessly chasing the so called success defined by the society.",
      "True! Losing our health is not due to one thing like eating a pizza in your strict \"diet\".\n\nIt's due to many factors like balanced diet, quality sleep, stress management, and hydrating our body.",
      "I agree. Constant peer pressure & glorification of hustle culture often push us to overextend ourselves.",
      "Dilip Kumar, totally agree. IMHO, the current positive economic environment has also helped (besides Gen Z's attitude to life). Corporates need to understand what drives their employees. PS - It is NOT gourmet cafeteria services or stellar workplace interiors!! 🙂 🙂 ",
      "100%. Thanks for the reminder Dilip Kumar",
      "Prioritize Health #1. Period.",
      "True! It's refreshing to see younger generations prioritizing health over wealth. It's a reminder that true wealth encompasses more than just financial success. Finding balance and maintaining well-being is essential for a fulfilling life. 🌟",
      "health is wealth",
      "Which 20-year-olds are you meeting? Dilip Kumar",
      "You’ve captured an essential truth—real wealth includes health and well-being, not just financial success. Prioritizing mental and physical health is a long-term investment that pays dividends far beyond monetary gains. True wealth is freedom in every aspect of life.",
      "But don’t worry, the corporate world will soon remind us that a walk on a random Wednesday morning doesn’t pay the bills, and taking time for yourself is basically heresy. After all, what’s the point of living past 40 if you’re not a broken, burnt-out shell who just happens to have some shiny ESOPs and an impressive LinkedIn profile? Priorities!",
      "An interesting thing to see is: A sick person will be willing to spend any amount of money to get their health back\n\nMost times- you are unable to \n\nThere is 0 upside of trading health for money",
      "True wealth is found in your health, not just in your bank account.",
      "Well said Dilip - Often, we blame external circumstances for our failure to maintain a healthy lifestyle (tight deadlines, demanding projects, constant hustle). But deep down, we all realize that, eventually, it is the pursuit of a sound body and mind that truly matters. You rightly pointed out \"Becoming unhealthy is not an event, but a slow process - just like losing money, it is the culmination of neglect over time.\"\n\nIt is time for organizations to also catch up. Some visionary companies have already started investing in the well-being of their employees, redefining what it means to care for their teams, often called \"family.\" This is more than a trend - it is a necessary evolution in the way we work and live.\n\nIn the end, health isn’t just a personal responsibility—it is a collective one. If we can foster an environment where well-being is prioritized at all levels, both individuals and businesses can thrive together.",
      "How does one measure “wealthy” ? Is it only possession of money or few other things that money can’t buy ?",
      "Exactly Dilip Kumar as we apply research methods with corporate India, there is still a perception that Under 30 population doesn’t require much intervention with regards to mental as physical well-being compared to 30+. But these effects happen over time as you rightly said, and escalate quickly in many cases.",
      "What are the root causes for more 20 yr olds saying about mental health.",
      "True that. Real wealth is not just about the money in your bank or how your company is doing, it's about having the time and energy to enjoy life, take care of the people you care about, and focus on what really matters. 👍",
      "After all, what's the value of financial success if we don't have the vitality to enjoy it?",
      "I think the evolution of the concept of healthspan over lifespan is something the youth today relates too. And I agree to your point, the real luxury is slow mornings. \n\nStriking the right balance is key. It’s good to see people prioritising their health (body and mind) earlier.\n\nInsightful post, Dilip Kumar",
      "healthy man has many wishes, a sick man only one - only until this realisation.\n",
      "Right said Dilip 🙌 being an active sportsman 🚴🏼‍♂️ I can vouch for this :- There’s no use of wealth if you don’t have good health !!",
      "Absolutely the last line!",
      "Well said. Detox your body to improve gut brain connection & retard microclots,",
      "Very True ! Staying healthy in mind and body is the most foundational thing for realising full potential for self and society !",
      "It’s social conditioning that’s forced us to accept the hustle life as the norm but it wasn’t a few decades ago .. the present hatchlings are now unlearning this and it is a good thing as they will be more prevalent on their organisations to accept a slower way of life too .. this doesn’t just mean lesser work .. it means longer employee engagements, less toxic environments, happier outputs, love for work … remote ways of work make it more easier now than ever .. the many news of employee burnouts is a call to create easier work environments rather than highlighting any human weakness .. the output per individual today is much higher than it has ever been in history and people are handling far more complex tasks than during the “age of industrialisation “",
      "It's inspiring to see a shift towards prioritizing health over wealth among the younger generation. Your words resonate. How do you think societal norms play a role in shaping this new mindset?  How do you think we can better educate others on the importance of holistic well-being?  ",
      "That’s heartening to know \n\nSteps on the right path \n\nHealth has been long ignored because \n\n- no time\n- it’s not convenient \n- it’s not fast \n\nBut ultimately… it’s the only thing which would matter and keep everything together",
      "It all starts with a small step... And if done with the right intent, becomes a habit. \n\nMy aim...is to consistently manage a monthly SIP of 12k ;-) and increase the SIP amount each quarter",
      "Dilip Kumar  Health is Wealth aligns perfectly with this story. ",
      "I have mixed feelings about this. While we all would want the youth to prioritise well-being, I am yet to come across a pathbreaking entrepreneur or inventor or artist — you know, the 1% who’ve built this world that we enjoy today — who didn’t sacrifice sleep and food and relationships in their 20s in the service of their obsession.",
      "Agree, many of us do not action but only recognize the importance.",
      "You don't even need an hour every day. 15 minutes of exercise will massively reduce your risk of cancer, heart ailments, diabetes, hypertension.\n\nDilip Kumar",
      "So true! Health is often overlooked in the pursuit of wealth, but it’s the most valuable asset we have. We need to prioritize it.",
      "Dilip Kumar ......true.",
      "Yup! Wealth redefined.",
      "Happy to see good health prioritised and amplified on your platform 🤝 Adding this post to our social proof so we can make a stronger case for well-being"

      "Thank you Dilip Kumar. Faster, Higher, Stronger - Together.",
      "Dilip Kumar\n\nYour message reflects an important and inspiring perspective. \n\nEncouraging and supporting athletes in their journey, both in success and in times of struggle, is essential to building a robust sports culture in India. \n\nIt's true that consistent support, not just financially but emotionally, can make a huge difference in athletes' lives. \n\nBy recognizing and celebrating even the smaller milestones, we can create a strong ecosystem that fosters growth, resilience, and determination.\n\nYour partnership with GoSports Foundation is a significant step in the right direction. \n\nSupporting organizations that focus on athlete development and creating long-term frameworks for their success can truly help India rise on the global sports stage. \n\nIt's wonderful to see initiatives like Rainmatter by Zerodha contributing to this cause, and this collective effort will certainly help future athletes make the nation proud.\n\nCheering for Indian athletes in every step, whether they win or lose, will build a more inclusive and passionate sports community, and seeing the Indian flag shine globally brings immense pride to the country. \n\nKeep up the excellent work in pushing this forward!",
      "Absolutely, Dilip! Here's to playing our part in contributing to this vision with what we’re building. It’s exciting to be part of something that can drive real change and create a lasting impact for India’s future!",

However, this proposition was not passed by the government.\n\nWhat does the man do? Builds his own vending machines in India with coins that work perfectly. Mind you, this is a time when coins wouldn’t always work in public telephone booths.",

      "Today's generation is missing out on so many things!! \n\nI'm not aware of this milk dispensing thing but being a 90's kid, I also have some good share of memories that are gone away now, and the fun is also lost.\n\nYour posts took me back to those good old days, Dilip Ji.",
      "It was fascinating to see milk being dispensed by a machine,the good old days.",
      "I feel like I might be older, or perhaps my city didn't have milk vending machines back in the day. We used to go to a dairy farmer's house, where they lived in a community, and every morning, fresh milk was brought directly from the cow. The dairy farmer would pour the amount we needed into our cans.\n\nIt wasn't until 2015, when I moved to Delhi for work, that I saw a Mother Dairy vending machine for the first time.",
      "nostalgic! ",
      "It's different here. We have a cow, and Grandpa milks it, so we get fresh milk every day.",
      "Am thinking the USP of most of the new apps/services isabout removing in person interaction as much as possible..",
      "I got to get milk at 7Rs a little. Guess the period? ",
      "Omg I remember going with my cousin in Delhi to get milk this way. It was the most exciting thing ever! And so environment friendly (get your own vessel/dabba) and healthy (given the walk).",
      "Sometimes, the nostalgia of simpler times reminds us of the joy in small, everyday rituals.",
      "The pleasure of thinking about analog memories  in this digital age.\n\nDilip Kumar Thank you.",
      "I completely agree with you. Nowadays, there's hardly any social interaction. I remember as a kid, weekends were something to look forward to—going to the market, visiting grandma's house, watching a movie in the theater while enjoying popcorn. But it feels like those precious moments have come to a sudden halt.",
      "I rmmbr back in the days, I used to go with my cousin just to put coin in the machine and wait for the milk..it used to be so much fun 😊",
      "There will be a day when we get bored of plastic and be back to ecologically sustainable products. Reusable glass bottles. Steel cans. \n\nAnd we get to live that life again …",
      "Totally agree! The nostalgia of those small, everyday rituals is something today’s generation might not experience. It’s amazing how something as simple as buying milk could turn into a fun routine.",
      "I enjoyed going and Buying milk from the Aavin Booth (Govt Dairy of Tamil Nadu ), the boys of my school who had a crush on me never used to let me stand in the Queue and they would stand for me and  make me sit under the tree shade and even buy me junglee baers for 50 paise and Sometimes they used to even go to my home and handover the milk can to my mom while I returned home later after playing in the nearby playground. Nostalgic! 🤣 🤣 ",
      "Kinda different here. The milkman comes on his modified bike, blows the horn twice, we get a signal he is here...take that big vessel (patila) with channi and then he pours the milk into that vessel 🙌 ",
      "I totally agree growing up in Delhi where we had these mother dairy outlets in every area. Standing in queues ...excited to have coins in hand...wait for milk to come and stop after every coin is inserted...\nYou made me go back to my memories",
      "People don't realise that sitting at home will do no good to you. They are becoming lazy and obese day by day and this behaviour is more dangerous. Once you are addicted to it there is no coming back from it. It becomes a lifestyle.",
      "Not to forget how eco-friendly it was! No plastics and zero waste",
      "The milk tasted creamier and smelled great too. The charm of inserting the coin was the fun part. ",
      "There are more ancient experiences where milkman would come to your home and directly pour the milk in your container straight from his'. The packet delivery is just automation of that I believe Dilip Kumar ",
      "Golden days they were......as a kid, it felt like magic!",
      "That's for the Tier 1 cities experience...On country side, I miss walking up early at 4 am and seeing my uncle milking the cattles ...where he would ask me to sit down next to the buffalo or cow and he'd point the teats to my face....That purest stream of milk is nowhere to be found in urban life.\n\nBut I still can go to my village and experience the same. ",
      "Totally agreed, ecommerce and hyper availability of almost everything has taken away so much - walking , excuse to go out, joy of buying ice cream and eating while waiting in queues. A lot is missed, specifically the charm of walking with grandparents or a friend to such shops",
      "I feel old admitting this, but I use to walk to a khataal with dad, watch cows getting milked, play with calves and get fresh milk back in a steel can :)",
      "Ohh dear I loved it . More environment friendly as well. Plus you could talk to others standing in the line ! Also the DMS and mother dairy used to take used milk packets and save them from ending up in the landfills",

      "Great to be part of this Dilip Kumar",
      "Very insightful , watched the entire podcast in one go 😀\nThanks Sudarshan Gangrade and Ahana Gautam",
      "The reasons y healthy brands are not taking over is the price point..most of them are overpriced..and everyone wants to milk the opportunity",
      "Always so wonderful to listen to Sudarshan Gangrade … his passion towards the mission and Lo! is infectious and inspiring!",
      "It’s inspiring to see startups challenging the status quo in a market dominated by giants Dilip Kumar.",
      "Dilip Kumar you are doing an excellent job with your dialogues series and your posts on LinkedIn",
      "In this podcast, Ahana Gautam and Sudarshan Gangrade discuss creating healthier packaged foods and navigating the challenges of a competitive market.",
      "Dilip Kumar:  Bajo Foods use palm oil in all their snacks. Also, they use hdrogenated fats and sugar alcohols in their chocolates/sweet snacks. Would love to know what made you think they are solving for health...just because they market themselves as healthy? Request you to do a basic ingredient check before you promote such brands in future.",
      "🙏 ",
      "Dilip Kumar\n\nKey Points for the Podcast\n\n1. Market Size: India's packaged food industry is worth $186 billion.  Chocolates and snacks are key segments, valued at $3.8 billion and $5.3 billion, respectively.\n\n2. Opportunity: There’s room for healthier alternatives as consumer demand for wellness grows.\n\n3. Challenges for Startups: Competing with established brands requires innovation in product quality, pricing strategies, and distribution.\n\n4. Why Eat Healthy: Reduces lifestyle diseases, lowers healthcare costs, and promotes overall well-being.\n\nGuests:\n\n1. Ahana Gautam (Open Secret) and Sudarshan Gangrade (Bajo Foods) will share their experiences in creating healthy food options and navigating the competitive market.\n",
      "One of the reasons why junk food flourishes is its easy availability. Making healthy food easily and widely available is the way to trump junk food. Its not easy though but surely worth a try for the sake of our kids and ourselves."

      "The Indian sports industry is still lagging behind, not due to a lack of investment in our elite athletes, but because of deficiencies in research and development, applied sports sciences, and the availability of top-notch, homegrown technical support staff. We remain overly reliant on Western coaches in most Olympic sports, which hinders the development of indigenous expertise.\n\nAt the grassroots level, the situation is even more concerning. The basic facilities necessary for nurturing future athletes are insufficient, and there has been a lack of comprehensive studies to address this. Rather than spreading resources thinly across all sports in every state, a more strategic approach is needed. We should focus on identifying which sports have the most potential in specific states and concentrate our resources there. This would involve targeted investment in states that naturally produce talent in particular sports, rather than wasting funds in regions where there is little interest or potential.",

      "Great listen Dilip Kumar with a lot of good points made.\n\nPersonally, I believe, a (large) part of the problem lies in the cultural mindset when it comes to pushing limits.\n\nThe primary problem is very much still a question of priorities and choices when it comes to sports vs academics and this requires a major change in parent’ mindsets.\n\nBut, while the government and corporates can do a lot to improve infrastructure and standards, I don’t think it’s going to change if we simply depend on institutions to help solve the lack of success.\n\nThere is a tendency for people to make general excuses such as genetics, diet, weather, poverty, infrastructure etc etc for why we don’t have more success. \n\nFor each one of the above, there is a country or athlete that will have proven otherwise. \n\nHaving coached kids in a sport, I have seen plenty of “talent” gone to waste either from a change in priorities or from excuses mentioned above.\n\nHappy to have a private chat Dilip Kumar about some of the issues, I believe, keep us from having more success in sports…and not just the Olympics.",

      "All key challenges and areas to work in Indian sports are well covered. Working with para-athletes like Suhas L.Y., Sumit Antil, Sundar Gurjar, and Shweta Sharma has provided deep insights into their daily struggles. I believe social media can significantly boost awareness for these athletes and promote other sports beyond cricket. There's widespread criticism of the BCCI for not supporting other sports, but we must remember who supported these athletes during their toughest times. The real issue lies with our politicians and bureaucrats; only a few show genuine interest in sports development, while many are driven by ego and photo ops post-medal wins. Despite this, I'm optimistic. There is a visible shift as more parents are now encouraging their children to pursue sports other than cricket. Change is definitely on the horizon.",

We also did weekly tracker training’s with a fitness trainer to check the daily progress and it turned out to be a success as there is physical activity, emotional bonding because of a common goal and lots of sweat shedding and laughter together that eventually impacts into positive and healthy culture and good health does impact our work performance and life state :)",

      "Thoughful initiative. Simple & Crisp",
      "Here’s another thing to try…..\n\nAsk everyone to close their eyes and think of the happiest memory of their life and then ask how it is impacting their today’s life and thoughts…..\n\n\nNow repeat the same by asking them to do the same with their worst or most painful memory and how that’s is impacting their life…. If you see tears or anxiety or sweating then that’s a sign of their mental health. \n\nPS: Please do above under a trained therapist",
      "I have Clients who are able to reimburse the fitness coaching fee through their company. Some companies reimburse gym memberships. I think these are great options instead of checkbox initiatives like a yoga session here and there.\n\nDilip Kumar ",
      "'Culture' is the key!",
      "This is such a great message.\n\nFitness should be kept simple because it is actually too damn simple.",
      "Dilip Kumar This is walking the talk :-)",
      "Great Initiative! 💕 Health is often taken for granted, but such initiatives help to spark the thought to get things back to shape! 💪 "

      "That's a great example! To all the women out there, do lift weights not just for the physical benefits it brings to you, but to become a stronger backbone to your family.",

      "Nailed it!",

      "This is fantastic news. The BCCI's management of men's cricket, and now women's cricket, has been outstanding in terms of customer engagement and profitability. It might not be a bad idea to consider giving them the reins of other sports as well. We could potentially see a significant turnaround under their leadership ;)",
      "BCCI always supported the other sports as per their abilities, dating back to 2008-09 bcci also helped AIFF with some money but they can’t just blindly give whoever in need coz it will send a strong message that a national sport body is having bigger budget than government and many people in government will not like it.",

BCCI as a private org is free to spend as much as they wish on the sport which gives them the maximum profit.",

      "GOI spent Rs.470.00 Cr. during Paris Olympics campaign vs mere Rs.36.85 cr. during 2016 RIO considering India's performance under TOPS (Target Olympic Podium Scheme) in Tokyo 2020. This has happened only coz of Neeraj Chopra's performance consistency & possibility in few other identified disciplines to excel further... 😊 ",

      "Your post, while well-intentioned, appears to be misleading. As per my limited recollections, BCCI generally has been financially supporting Olympic contingents in previous edition(s) too. Ref: https://olympics.com/en/news/indian-cricket-board-sanctions-inr-10-crore-for-india-s-tokyo-2020-campaign. Additionally, your screen grab seems to suggest that BCCI's gesture (particularly Jay Shah's tweet) is in response to your original tweet - which I believe isn't the case.",

What is govt doing with all the taxes & money collected. We should hold them accountable for these things. \n\nIf BCCI pays tax honestly and if Sports ministry uses funds honestly, problem is solved at root cause. ",
      "Valid point",
      "You manifested it! And everyone who engaged with the post said, Tathastu! 🥰",
      "Fantastic news and thanks for encouragement to speak our mind out.",
      "Sports is just not a form of entertainment but it builds character, resilience, team spirit and ability to get up after being knocked down and many more health benefits. These are life skills that makes a country better and future ready.\nIt is high time sports should get more importance in education system to build great citizens.",
      "Super gesture by Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and there's no point in always ostracizing cricket - it is what it is and if it can support other sports, why not. Why hate on them as most people do.\n\nAnd totally agree on the 'speak your mind' part - people do not realise the power of their own voice. I frequently share grouses and even compliments on some major companies on personal experience and 100% of the time, it makes an impact. I even posted on Indigo, the monopoly airline and their below average service over a few weeks when I took several flights - apart from huge engagement and people sharing the same sentiment, the Airline and very senior director level folks immediately responded 1-1 over calls and it showed they cared. Same for many companies.\n\nPeople just think - how will it matter and brush things aside. How wrong.",

      "Love this reminder about the importance of priority physical activity and healthy eating for overall well-being and longevity. I completely agree that waiting for motivation can be a slippery slope. Building healthy habits and consistency is key. One small step at a time can make a huge difference in the long term.\n",
      "100%. We're blindly chasing productivity and escaping the functioning of the human body. However, the study was conducted between 2000 and 2022. I'm not sure if this reflects the status quo and whether the data collected during COVID times affects this number to an extreme.\n\nBut, regardless of the questions around the study and how the statistics look today, extreme inactivity is fatal, and we're seeing an increasing number of untimely deaths amongst the younger populations. \n\nWe really need to take our health as seriously as we've taken social media and GenAI. ",
      "Absolutely! Health isn't something we can delegate or wait for motivation to achieve. It's about daily choices—prioritizing movement, nourishing our bodies, and nurturing well-being. I see firsthand how crucial these choices are for peak performance and longevity.",
      "So true! Taking care of your health is a personal responsibility that no one else can fulfill for you. As someone passionate about both startups and fitness, I've learned firsthand how neglecting health can impact everything.",
      "Absolutely Dilip Kumar! You can delegate tasks or automate things, but when it comes to health, only you can exercise and take care of yourself.",
      "I've myself experienced that even the smallest changes in habits can ripple into significant improvements in health.",
      "Right on point! I realised this in my early 20s. \nSurely, it's never too late to start working on physical health, but foundations built early on will make it easier for the later part of life. \nMany people in their 20s take their health for granted. Start now! ",
      " When I was working in the health sector, I was shocked to see 15 year old kids dealing with high cholesterol and blood sugar levels due to a sedentary lifestyle and terrible eating habits. Obesity is spreading like wildfire.",
      "Your third paragraph is the most important to note. Most people underestimate their health and take it for granted. I have seen and experienced worst possible situations with my close freinds and how it affects their dependents. \n\nOur body will always give symptoms to us and if we keep ignoring it, the hardware is going to crash one day without warning. Its of no use feeling hard at that point. It puts the individual and the family under extreme stress both mentally, physically and let’s not forget about the medical expenses.\n\nDilip Kumar thanks for sharing.",
      "It’s high time we get the awakening and be serious towards ourselves and be more cautious for our physical fitness as well as mental and emotional. It’s simple and not that expensive, it’s just about being disciplined and loving yourself.",
      "@dilip Kumar Fresh Air Water are more essential, which is where we all struggling irrespective of how disciplined we are we can't escape from the trap ",

We have elevators. \nWe have coffee machines on each floor.  \nWe try to be productive. \nSome people eat at their desks as they cannot waste a single minute. \n\nNo walking only sitting. \n\nAnd finally one day, we use the same money on hospitals.  \n\nThe sad part is when we are in this process of gradual daily deterioration of our health, we don’t have any RAG or KPI meter to let us know that :-\n\n-Life reduced by 1 day, Status Amber. \n\nOr \n\n-Total number of Lifedays remaining: 5506 (-10% from last months average). Status RED \n/!\\ Warning : At this rate, you would die 10 years before the average life span.",

This hit me very late in life, but I'm glad I made the choice to turn things around, from being as unfit as a 135 kgs, and losing a 70 kgs in the last few years, it's not only turned around my \"physical health\" but transformed my \"mental health\" by magnitudes! I hope people take their physical health seriously, sooner than later.",
      "Loved the last line Dilip Kumar.  \nIf you wait until you’re motivated you have already lost it.  \n\nThe problem with keeping health at check with most people is that life has been taken for granted. \n\nPeople realize it hard way.",
      "Dilip Kumar thanks for sharing. More than anything else everyone should take a good look at themselevs every single day in front of an un varnished truthful  mirror and take action.\nIt just takes a 5 min plan routine or a 7 min workout or a round of suryanamaskar to start getting back in shape. 💪🔙👍🙏",
      "This is amazing post. Dilip Kumar Your work to health community is next level ",
      "Good insight! Can we also relate this  to India being land of mental health issues specially in young and adolescents?\nDilip Kumar ",
      "What about the other half? \n\nAlso, the concept oh physically fit is a Western Concept. \n\nYou should read the Anthropology behind the Greek Olympics and it’s impact on the world.",
      "Understanding the importance of a healthy lifestyle can be tough. Often, personal experiences provide the clearest lessons on how crucial it really is. \nEven more concerning is the rising number of childhood obesity.",
      "Any numbers on mental health ? I think that percentage may be higher. And then what’s the subset which is both mentally and physically fit ? :)",
      "India's water, food, sanitation and other supply chains need a re-look. Lancet study would have simply provided an over simplified suggestion but the problem needs more deeper analysis. The benefits should be available to the last of the common man for this to be solved.  \nPerhaps a return back to yoga and traditional lifestyles will be good solve. But scaling them to supply chains is something that needs ingenious solves. ",
      "Thought-provoking"

    "text": "Bring a bunch of founders under one roof, let them talk to each other, give no gyaan. And magic will happen. Last Friday was this. \nDid an impromptu Health Founders meet-up in Delhi last Friday. 180+ people signed up. Could only admit 40 due to space limitations. All of them showed up and few brought their co-founders along.\n\nI thought events and meet-ups were in abundance. Maybe 5-10 people will turn up. But 50 founders were hanging out for 4 hrs on a Friday evening. And all passionate about health and building products to make Indians healthy. \n\nThere was no speech, no panel, no agenda. \nBut entrepreneurs have an innate ability to communicate. So they all started talking to each other. Figured that networking is overrated. But a space to have unfiltered conversations and be your authentic is underrated. \n\nSome got new customers.\nSome met their customers who were using their products. \nSome got offer to share the office space.\nSome validated their new product ideas.\nSome established new partnerships. \nLot of questions on why, what and how. \nAnd a few made their funding pitch. Founder preamble you know :) \nThere was learning and a some unlearning. \n\nApologies for people we couldn’t admit. There was a genuine space limitation. \nIt was an experiment and i dint expect this much response. \n\nAt Rainmatter our credo is to add meaningful support to the ecosystem. \nEither through capital allocation or cheering for entrepreneurs. \nShould we do this more often? In other cities?",

An unassuming mother of two young Indian chess prodigies Praggnanandhaa and Vaishali. The first-ever brother-sister duo to both earn the Grand master title. Today both of them are well known for their achievements in the sport. Most don’t know that their mother, Nagalakshmi accompanies them to tournaments for encouragement and support. Father Rameshbabu works as a branch manager at TNSC Bank and is honest to say they were facing financial constraints but were determined to support both their kids. \n\nI’ve now spent time with Olympians, World champions & India no.1 on my podcast and a common thread amongst all of them is their early childhood and the parental support all of them had.  The most important economic decisions a society makes are not made in corporate offices, but in homes.\nhttps://x.com/kmr_dilip",

      "True!",

      "The story of Nagalakshmi, Praggnanandhaa, and Vaishali is truly inspiring, Dilip. It beautifully underscores the critical role that family support and determination play in the making of champions. Your words serve as a poignant reminder that the real heroes often work behind the scenes, fostering environments where resilience and excellence can thrive.  ",

      "True",
      "Nice one and a good msg for the society",

      "All have their mountain to climb, their resources to utilise, their opportunities to capitalize, and their support system to revolutionize.",
      "It’s amazing how behind every great achievement, there’s often a family making sacrifices and providing unwavering support.

      "Love the confidence that shines through ",
      "Awesome 👍🏻",
      "Dilip Kumar yes you are tight. It's made in homes. 13Year old neighbor practicing athletics for the past 4 years. \nWent through the process of decision making where every month they continue coaching or not. Their need for money is one part. But a parent who drops them, picks up them and puts effort into managing their studies also, must be highly appreciated. They are the reason for results we achieve.  Thanks for bringing up behind the screen Nagalakshmi amma to the front screen.",
      "Good share 👍 ",
      "Starting early and having a supportive family is perhaps the secret sauce of all successful outliers. Is there any repeatable pattern/insight for someone who perhaps missed the bus on both accounts?",
      "Thanks Dilip Kumarfor bringing the story behind the success of these two GMs. It is heartening that the journey they made is against the accepted idiom that RICH, EDUCATED and CONNECTED effort works better.",
      "Home, House, Environment, Encouragement can bring the best among our kids 😁",
      " It's truly inspiring to see the unwavering support and dedication of parents like Nagalakshmi and Rameshbabu, who play a pivotal role in shaping the success of their children. Their sacrifices and encouragement lay the foundation for a bright future. Thank you for sharing this heartwarming story, Dilip Kumar.  ",
      "Family support and having a good supporting system is very important for professional success.",
      "Vanshika Kaushik",
      "Absolutely love the videos Dilip Kumar where she is quietly watching from the sidelines as her children are mobbed by fans and press. And how the children rush up to her after every match. Very little seems to be spoken but the quiet confidence and ambition is sparkling in their eyes.",
      "Very proud to see this! \n\nKids - often they have an internal athlete inside them. Upon finding the right sport (as a parent you will know by time), the right coach, and parents support could result in changing their mindset and producing a better athlete. Kids love ❤️ sports also. \n\n#sports #fitness #children",
      "It definitely is the parental support that helps kids rise above the challenges to reach such great heights. Just that when these great heights is in sports (esp other than cricket) that definitely needs to be lauded. And which is where more than their sacrifices on financial front are their efforts on instilling the right mindset, their encouragement, the sense of discipline has to be appreciated ",
      "Last line… so true!",
      "IMO Dilip, for any Sports achiever, it is the parents who take the first decision and make the sacrifice for the kid to develop into a champion.",
      "Exceptional sharing Dilip Kumar",
      "Very true Dilip Kumar ! If it takes a village to raise a child, it takes an entire ecosystem to raise a Champion; and the initial hustle and struggle of Parents and first coach can never be discounted. With increasing awareness and career potential in Sports, (i hope) we will be seeing a lot more such stories from Bharat.",
      "Parental guidance truly shapes champions, Dilip Kumar!",
      "Blessed are those who get phenomenal  support from their parents after knowing where they are genius at! Pure dedication! ",
      "Lucky are the children.. whose parents allowed them to choose their professional paths and not ask them to do things according to the parents choice ",
      "Very proud of the Star Siblings👍👍",
      "Dilip Kumar, Ya, resilience is very important! Perseverance + Resilience make an incredible 1-2 punch!",
      "I find such narratives disturbing. They glorify the “against all odds” and don’t point out how inequities affect families. Behind every such story (even on screens) is hero worship of almost the circumstances which we don’t see changing at all. Every year we see olympians lauded, their “poverty” glorified, their caretakers talked about and yet we don’t focus the lens on the poverty enough to change system thinking on the support sports heroes families need. Hell we don’t definitely talk about how acutely it affects the families when these heroes are begging and dying on the streets. I hope we change the lens soon because otherwise we will go through the same cycle of galvanizing government school teachers who “go above and beyond” while completely staying mute on the reality of inequities.",
      "Absolutely ..so while society encourages a family where  both parents work ....The critical question remains .when both parents work ...Who gives Support to the young and budding stars ? .. who gives care to the sick , weak ,slow and aged ?\n\nEarlier  people kept 1/3 rd of the day ( not week )  for supporting - Young children old  patents and relatives , sick  neibours and the community , society ....But with an emphasis on doing more and faster ...this support has gone down.",
      "I completely resonate with your lines \" the most important economic decessions a society makes are not made in corporate offices , but in homes\". Just wondering how many gems are hidden in this space. ",
      "Dilip Kumar Absolutely! \n\nThe role of supportive parents in the journey of athletes, artists, or anyone pursuing excellence cannot be overstated. \n\nNagalakshmi's dedication to her children's dreams and her unwavering support despite financial challenges is truly inspiring. \n\nIt's a testament to the power of familial love and encouragement in nurturing talent and resilience. \n\nAnd you're spot on about the significance of early childhood experiences and parental support in shaping future champions. \n\nIt's a beautiful reminder that success is often built on a foundation of love, determination, and support from home.",
      "Totally love and agree with the last line. This is something parents need to understand and realize! They play a very important role not just to raise their kids but contribute to the development of the nation. ",
      "Absolutely, this beautiful gesture can never be forgotten that every great achievement often starts with the unwavering support from family.",
      "If you've got your mother's prayers, you have got everything and more",
      "Truly incredible work bringing such stories forward Dilip Kumar and team! Best wishes",
      "Totally relate to the need for support at home to empower the next generation to greater heights. However, a lot of households and parents are stuck, either in a resource shortage or in deep gendered inequities that has significant consequences for the next generation. Shambhavi Srivastava covers a lot of the issues behind systemic inequities at home, particularly related to raising children on Instagram @thegreatindiansexism . Our society doesn't support homes or families sufficiently. If we did, I think we would have a great potential for significant economic and athletic/sporting growth."

      "Taking this train of thought a step further, I feel like the interpretation of the data and research involved wrt improvement in fitness causes a lot of friction for people pursuing any fitness goal. \n\nAlong with the HOW biomarkers are changing and WHY they are, if there was a way to continously suggest areas of improvement and tactics from personalized data collection, it would remove a great deal of friction from the process and possibly increase adherence.  \n\nI believe this is done on a case by case basis by personal trainers and nutritionists now, but could be done on a larger scale with the right methods to collect the personalized data. (Mostly because finding good nutrionists and personal trainers who are trustworthy is hard, which I exactly what believe Fittr is solving)\n\nPS: Will it be possible for you to share the 500+ companies solving for health/fitness in a repository of some sort?, I'm sure it would be helpful for a lot of us. ",
      "Health is not a mere sum total of all parameters neither is nutrition a sum total of all ingredients ",
      "Out of the 500+ startups, have you come across a startup which offers a holistic solution combining the following in a single app -\n1. Basic exercises/strength training \n2. Yoga and meditation \n3. Diet/nutrition .. ??",
      "My sister, a plastic surgeon, has an idea to build an interesting AI-driven application along these lines. ",
      "Dilip Kumar We'd love the opportunity to be 501+ on that list of healthcare startups you've spoken to! We believe we're solving for something big, that can bring together consumer health screening and tracking into a single powerful app that can give clues as to the WHY of health!",
      "I believe, to know why something is happening in your body , you need to have AI with you 24 hours everyday, always listening to you, always watching you. Knowing almost everything you are doing everyday and everything happening everyday with you. For example: That tech should know that today you have some fierce talk with your wife and you are upset or today you got your salary with a bonus and you are surprisingly happy, literally everything it should know to give you the best answer for why or how there are any good or bad changes in your health or could happen, or there is any room to make the things better. \n\nThere should be an AI chip implanted in the brain that can analyse the neurological links, process it and send required output to your wearable devices. Or maybe something similar which can tell almost everything about you and feed that data to AI. \n\nBest of luck to those who are going to make such Advanced and Accurate AI, but even if it gets developed , there would be many hurdles to get it positioned in the market. 👍",
      "That's a brilliant insight!\n\nAt Cranberry, we are building with the WHY for women's health. Our learning - we need robust health protocols which can point us to the probable causes, every data point captured OR shared should have a back story or future (preventive) :). We are also keen on making these health protocols - open source - as we truly believe with need more people sharing WHYs over magic solutions and graphs. ",
      "Also the wearables should reach diagnostic grade.",
      "And the WHY need not be technology based - it could even be consultation with specialists based on the HOW and WHERE info that's collected already. (If the info collected via wearables is not sufficient to figure out the Why, it could narrow down the diagnostic journey by having only the required tests done)\n\nI'd also assume, that'll make it easier to go another step further to provide corrective measures and changes that need to be implemented to course-correct (WHAT Next?)",

      "Interesting take !! \n\nWHOOP does answer this aspect to some extent, though not granular! My HRV is 41% less than my usual baseline limits , and it tells me to hydrate more and focus on relaxing activities!! Also, Whoop has a Beta Coach imbibed in the app, and I can ask what all things caused the spike or drop and it gives me a quick inference, Though generic but I think pretty soon we’ll get there !",
      "Absolutely agree! Knowing the \"why\" behind health data can change the game. 🔍 Dilip Kumar",
      "Hmmm...do you think the science behind the \"why\" is both robust and sophisticated enough yet to even know the answer with a high enough confidence interval?\n\nI mean I'd absolutely love such a service but kind of skeptical about it's reliability.\n\nCurious to hear your take",
      "Your insight on the untapped potential of \"WHY\" in health tech and nutrition is spot-on. While current solutions focus on the \"HOW\" and \"WHAT,\" addressing the underlying reasons behind health data and product benefits is key to creating lasting value and building lifetime users.",
      "Dilip Kumar   Solving the \"WHY\" would be an Herculean task as there would be more than 8 billion unique use cases mapped to world population...tech giants need to collaborate to arrive at such an 'utopian dream' solution",
      "I see why the WHY matters and brings a big opportunity. It creates more value for the user and the businesses. Leveraging data science to unveil the WHY is like generating actionable insights rather than just providing plain data/metrics.\n\nOnce the WHY is known, possible solutions and recommendations then become viable to be tested out against that WHY.",
      "Hi Dilip,\n\nWe, at Ariso, are building for ‘why’ certain foods suit some people and doesn’t suit the rest. Generally we are solving for food opacity and depersonalised food shopping and simultaneously answering the ‘whys’.\n\nWould love to have a chat with you Dilip Kumar!",
      "To achieve a deeper understanding of health and wellness, rigorous validation through RCT studies, advanced biometric analysis, and interdisciplinary collaboration are essential. By uncovering the WHY behind changes in health metrics, we can unlock new market opportunities and empower users for lifelong wellness. Great insights Dilip Kumar",
      "Look at the meaning of the root words for #Health and #Holistic, you will get your answer. \n\nWe aren’t Holistic in fullest sense in our approach and hence the problems (read lost opportunities). \n\n#HolisticMatters when it’s matter of #Health.",
      "Dilip Kumar rightly said",
      "Interesting observation. I would think that growth of “How” will build the market for “Why”. In simpler terms, tracking the metrics will pique people’s interest in knowing why metrics are behaving in certain way. Once the market of “How” reached a certain scale then automatically either the same companies will build on “why” or new companies working on “why” will come up.",
      "Solving for WHY from HOW is not just a keyword change.",
      "Neuphony™  can help figure out “Why” - by tracking neural triggers / map your brain’s signals as a reaction to some of these products. They also have a wearable device (smartwatch for the brain). They did a small experiment with a healthy tea brand. Tech is evolving quickly :) Dilip Kumar \n\nRia and Bhavya love talking about it! :)",
      "Very well articulated Dilip Kumar. Unless we investigate and understand what really caused that specific psychological change, most interventions are just a band aid. ",
      "Dilip Kumar thanks for sharing your thoughts openly, I am building a Lifestyle Functional food company and one of our angle is to understand the “Why” in Modern Health issues and Formulate our products on the basis of that. Your post gives me a positive thought that we are moving in the right direction. If given a chance I would like to talk more about it with you .",
      "As someone who digs for WHYs when it comes to health and nutrition related stuff, I have been surprised by people not caring enough for the WHYs.\n\nPeople who seek the WHYs are in minority is what I feel. Resulting into orgs not focusing on them?\n",
      "What this requires is building the medical repository to be used as reference. When we started Muse Diagnostics focussed on sound based diagnostics we realised the importance of creating sound repository that allows for every sound to be able to diagnoses from a reference guide. We should talk more because we are working in this witj sound based diagnostics as a use case.",
      "Hey Dileep,\n\nGreat insights! At WTF Gyms , we're on the same wavelength. Our app doesn't just track metrics; it explains the 'why' behind them. We're leaping ahead, focusing on nutrition, daily workouts, and essential body metrics. It's about showing members where they start on day 1 and guiding them towards their goals, spotlighting what's changing and why. This approach is already making a difference for us.\n\nAbsolutely agree with you — understanding the 'why' is crucial. It's not just about finding the reason but sticking to it and ensuring it doesn't become just another statistic. Your thoughts have sparked even more ideas for us, and thanks to this, we're excited to soon offer the WTF app to non-subscribers too. We want everyone to benefit from our scheduling system, nutritional guidance, and core tech features.\n\nLooking forward to building on these ideas and enhancing our community's health journey!",
      "To say ‘Why’ confidently one needs strong ethics, genuine intent and a sense of responsibility.",
      "I have a different point of view. Most folks care about only outcomes. So long as there is a basic explanation on how food and the human body work, it’s sufficient to bring awareness. Likewise all analytical tools only tell you if things are going right/wrong. The hardest challenge is behaviour changing for sustainable health. This is a complex problem being influenced by childhood behaviour, work, family, environment, physiology, emotions etc. The ones that benefit from say RHR, HRV are the ones who are already deeply into fitness and health. Likewise for the ones who care about understanding stuff from first principles. It’s a lot like the difference between being a chef , a cook and the vast majority that just want someone to give them tasty food.",
      "Understanding origin & progression of disease ( THE WHY) is the key. However, there is huge gap before wearables could decode. The current wearable tech is nothing but a small pie in disease management opportunity.\n\n For instance, CGM can tell you spike in blood glucose/blood sugar response/levels. But this does not help until we have info & data on GLUT 4- the protein that goes to cell membrane, bind to glucose, clear it from circulation & transport to cell for storage or energy. Therefore data on molecular signalling that activates GLUT 4 is the key.\n\nSimilarly, we may know HRV but unless we decode /measure norepinephrine and epinephrine levels or histamine signalling, HRV is of no use\n\nIf I am remember correctly, we had a brief call with your team a month back but I think there was gap in understanding our business model/ or the call was more of idea/innovation shopping.",
      "In my experience building an Electronic Health Record(EHR) this is extremely difficult to implement.\n\nHere's why: Root cause diagnosis has to be done by General Medicine doctors and not specialists because only root cause can tell exactly \"Why\" and this is how the process would flow for that:\n\nChief Complaint/Symptom\nClinical Finding\nDifferential Diagnosis\nChronic conditions(if any)\nGenetic conditions(if any)\nSocial Behaviours that can cause a condition\nAllergies\nAnd Lab Tests to validate\n\nAll these factors are necessary to know WHY. Now am assuming that you don't want it to exactly be a 100% but if it's not atleast \"quite accurate\" then the \"Why\" can scare the customer especially since most of the these wearables have a lot of inaccuracies. And having all this data captured by a wearable or otherwise is an expensive affair in my experience.\n\nAnd most importantly the \"Why\" is difficult even for a doctor to find. That's why it's called a Differential Diagnosis. #myexperience",
      "You are right. My view. I have studied many Healthy food products of USA. Many of them are doing proper research and making healthy food involving science in it. But at the same time, it is equally important to convey to the customer which they are doing beautifully.\nWhy and What product is doing has to be true and conveyed properly to the customer.",
      "I think the WHY for a certain bodily reaction is going to be difficult because the body is a complex machine and multiple things can trigger the same reaction. For example: The cortisol can rise due to a life threatening situation or just work stress.\n\nIn my humble opinion, another opportunity that's big is in educating what bodily reactions are problematic, if not managed for a long time, and how they can be managed or reduced in the future.",
      "Interesting take. I've had a chance to think a bit deeply on this (not as much however as I want to!) - and please take this with a grain of salt. \n\nI think research backed, innovation-led health startups are the future that solve ONE critical thing. Or co-related things. \n\nExample, there is a company solving for UTI diagnostics, they're created a completely new method for it. Another company is finding absolutely new ways to diagnose breast cancer early on. \n\nFinding the WHY requires research. Diabetes is still a myth, and I've always thought that businesses building around it should have a content gameplan that increases awareness around their solution.  ",
      "Why can also be messaging/positioning angle for a business to differentiate ",
      "Hi Dilip\nBy WHY are you referring more on end results a consumer trying to achieve?\nMy observations being: 40+ age bracket is ready to invest in health but isn't looking for being muscular. \nSome of the products that are targeting this segment is trying to reduce medicine intake \nThe reduced cost of medicines is a straightaway value observed \nPlease correct if my understanding is incorrect ",
      "The WHY will need deep investments in biotech!",
      "Instances backed by cause and resolution is what I see as the future of health especially from a consumer's lens. Today I spend atleast 2hrs a day reading about certain causes and solutions and then go through a trial and error with my body also because each body is different and a cookie cutter model can't be applied.

Very inspirational. We need more honest conversations like this out there. Keep up the great work!",

    "text": "An unpopular opinion about founders/VC's building and investing in health category. This may disappoint a few.\n\nFirst, if you are a founder building in the health. You've to walk the talk. \nWhat does that mean? You have to be healthy and fit. \n\n-The biggest moat in the health industry is trust. This can't be built by performance marketing or hiring influencers. \n-Why will a customer trust your product if the founder isn't healthy? You don't need six packs. But you shouldn't look unfit.\n-If your product came out from your own problem statement, great. Tell the world how you got there and share your experience. \n-In health industry you scale by not selling features. But by earning the trust. \n\nSecond, don't pitch or raise money from an investor who doesn't walk the talk. \n\n-To build a scalable business TAM is important. But impact is most important.\n- If the first question they ask is, how large is the business and not why you choose to build the product. That's a sign.\n- If an investor doesn't make an effort to experience your product or service and offer genuine feedback. They are truly not investing in you. But chasing vanity.\n- Have seen many VC events ending with alcohol and the food corner filled with junk. And that happens because they don't walk the talk and perhaps staying healthy is not their top priority in personal life. \n\nThat's it. Hope this changes. And we build businesses and products that brings impact on people. And trust is your anchor to scale.",

      "Thanks for that, I keep wondering when I see all these Organic brands pitching me to be in my store - and they have FAT founders. Or Founders who dont even know what their product is actually good for as they have never understood the problem it can actually solve. LOL",
      "Being a healthy founder sets the tone for your team and reflects dedication to your mission. ",
      "Oshin Anna Shaji Sonal Raj",
      "Dilip Kumar  very well said. In fact in my entrepreneurial journey I  have seen consumers trusting our products because I myself stay fit by participating in triathlons. We also do  nutrition awareness workshops which further strengthen our customers' trust in us. In fact, even as a customer, I myself avoid consuming food items from brands whose founders look unfit. This realisation was somewhere back in my head but glad you put it out straight.",
      "My father (ex-drug discovery scientist) - used share an insider joke of pharma industry:\n\"Marz bhi zinda rehna chahiye, aur mariz bhi\"\nThe patient should survive, but also the disease. ",
      "Completely agree with you, Dilip, that it's great to have an investor who truly walks the talk alongside you, but do you think it's an absolute necessity?\n\nAsking because we, Spocademy, are a sportstech startup and are planning to start reaching out to investors soon. Your thoughts would be a helpful starting point. ",
      "Good health and overall fitness should anyway be seen as a necessity to function better irrespective of one's profession. But yes, for founders building in this space, you can't choose to build in a category of health and be unfit (not thin or well shaped but fit). Because then the conviction of building is often coming from the current health industry data rather than a belief in what you're building. \n\nP.S.- +1 on unhealthy f&b at events. Often gone home and eaten dinner while at events I lived on fresh lime soda. ",
      "Very intresting and insightful post!",
      "Completely agree on Walk the talk for founder. But does the founder have a liberty or choice to choose an investor too who aligns with walk the talk culture.\n\nWell if you get one nothing like it but can founders wait to find such investors at the cost of business impact?",

      "I appreciate the emphasis on trust in the health industry, but I'm sceptical about the connection between a founder/VC s physical appearance and the trustworthiness of their product. Many factors contribute to someone's health and fitness, and it's unfair to assume that someone who may not look traditionally fit or healthy is incapable of creating a reliable and effective health product. I think it would be more valuable to focus on the product's research, testing, and scientific backing rather than the appearance of the founder/VC.",
      "Thanks Dilip for pointing to this discrepancy in action and speech; and for underlining our experience as a health & wellness start up. In our experience VCs and the investor community talk about supporting 'innovation' and 'make in India', 'value products' and 'women empowerment'. But there is no heft behind these now hollowed out  phrases. \nSo we chug along ... ",
      "I liked the fact that you mentioned 'walk the talk'.\n\nBecause, without the knowledge of that industry, it will be very difficult to solve the ground level problems.\n\nDilip",
      "Thank you for sharing these insights Dilip..",
      "Interesting ! Reminds me how I felt when I saw an unfit trainer at a gym and walked out. I do feel walking the talk on health is an evolving journey as we learn more about what affects us. Today more people are talking about the vital role that sleep plays in our health and longevity - often at conflict in our hustle culture :).  ",

      "This is unlike what happens in case of Indian Yoga teachers. I know so many Yoga teachers who don't look fit, have a paunch and are still very flexible. ",

      "Very aligned on this and thanks for talking about it because choosing the right partners is clear now.",
      "Staying fit is a must for every professional, just not limited to healthcare related.",
      "So well put Dilip! Echo your views completely! ",
      "Brands like Harley, Enfield greatly benefitted from CEOs who were also passionate riders. Healthy & Fit founders is a good starting point for a health startup 👏🏻",
      "Dilip Kumar, understanding and embodying the ethos of the health industry is fundamental to establishing a winning edge. Your insights very much reflect the essence of credibility and trust in building a successful organization. ",
      "Hit the nail in the head Dilip Kumar. The \"why\" has to extend from the founders walking the talk. You got to be the biggest consumer and star of your own product. I gobbled up Happy Ratio blends for years before I ever created it for the market.\n\nI also think about the following often. Gym owners should go to the gym and be seen working out. And cops should be made to do 100 meter sprints to keep their jobs! How can they catch crooks if they have a higher probability of dropping dead because of their diets.",
      "Very true Dilip Kumar! If in health, we need to walk the talk. We owe it to our children. \n\nI was obese over 130+ kgs, and now 98.5 kgs, and still some way to go. I am building in the childhood obesity space and made a promise to myself and my future child. We are all human beings, but how many are healthy beings? Seeing my fatty liver reverse, was such a high moment. \n\nWrote the following post on my aim to be healthy, and every team member will need to make a healthy promise. -https://www.linkedin.com/posts/surajprasad_letsinspire-healthrenaissance-personaljourney-activity-7156244789401653248-jnNo?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop ",
      "Absolutely! Many of these principles apply to other sectors as well. I'm in wealth management, so it helps that I was able to achieve my financial goals before I try to solve this problem for others.\n\nNitheesh Ballal and Nikita Yadav an interesting POV for you to consider!",
      "The problem with health is that we associate it with a certain look. Hence the need to \"walk the talk\". You can't look different from the accepted healthy look and work on something health related. \nWe do need awareness in this area as well. ",
      "Great insights Dilip Kumar junk food eating the good cells of brain and other parts of body and deteriorate overall brain and other organ health, where the healthy decision making starts,like slow poison,junk food divert the person from adopting healthy habits.To build trust among various stakeholders,founders story matters the most than anything else ",
      "This is a fairly matured thought! 100% agree!",
      "So I actually look at it a little differently Dilip Kumar. I believe that “walking the talk” so to speak not only gives you credibility but is in fact essential to building a health & wellness building. Beyond the superficiality of what one looks like, it is the ability to understand the space you operate in, the solutions you are building for your target customers, and the confidence that you have when you yourself have successfully tried those, that gives you a winning edge. For example, in my case, I can definitely say that my own journey has largely influences the growth of our organisation and the path we have taken towards growth. The community which I cherish the most is a function of the connect I have been able to build with people and this has only been possible because I truly embibe what I talk about.\n",
      "Dilip Kumar I find it interesting how you used healthy and fit interchangeably. Personally as a founder with chronic health issues like hypothyroidism and others , I felt pressurized to \"look fit\", avoided attending events as I felt it would impact my brand.  I guess being healthy physically and mentally is super crucial for a founder to perform optimally while \"looking fit\" shouldn't as much be. ",
      "Love it",
      "Very true! Reminded of what a cardiologist said once in jest to me, \"We ourselves organize samosas/kachori at Doctors/Pharma Conferences. I hope our patients don't see us at these.\"\n\nOn a serious note, when you do walk the talk, like in most products, you realise the friction and pain points of motivation that a customer truly faces. Apart from looking the part, it has also product development benefits. Health is one of those sectors where gestation period of impact is longer and every insight in that journey counts! ",
      "Very well put Dilip 👏",
      "Sonali Saraogi Singh- oh how we relate to this ;) \nDilip Kumar -  now if only there was a way to show impact and passion in numbers. I am sure it would turn out to be much bigger than any TAM ever :)",
      "💯 \nWhen you walk the talk, you understand problems at a much deeper level",
      "Wow WOULD YOU LIKE TO TALK ABOUT SEXUAL WELLNESS MY IDEA BASE STARTUP WHICH IS STILL A TABOO AND INVESTORS BEHAVING WEIRDLY TO TALK ABOUT IT \nIF THERE ARE NO SEXUAL WELLNESS DOCTORS AND PRODUCTS HOW WILL PEOPLE MAINTAIN BASIC HYGEINE , GET PROTECTED FROM UNWANTED PREGNANCIES , STD’s etc . AND IT IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT IN MULTIPLE WAYS AS MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH . THE MORE THEY TALK ABOUT IT FREELY IT WILL HELP THEM ONLY . BEING MODERN MEANS BEING EDUCATED BEING MODERN FROM YOUR THOUGHTS \n I  COULF BE WORKING ON ANY BUSINESS IDEA I HAVE TRAINED MYSELF LIKE THAT BUT MADE MY DECISION TO WORK ON IT BECAUSE I KNOW HOW YO CRACK THAT TABOO THING SOMEBODY HAS TO NOTHING WRONG IN IT .",
      "Well expressed Dilip!",
      "Love this, especially the point about healthier events. At the same time, hope to see the pool of investors taking action on their health grow. Thankful for your leadership, Dilip Kumar.",
      "Spoken like a sage! 😇\nBeing a practioner for a long period of time in a field where you are solving the problem builds not only trust but exposes you to different use cases which arises at different periods for a user. \nIt's very tempting to solve the obvious low hanging fruit problem but typically in an industry like health and fitness, it has a very long customer life cycle! ",
      "This is excellent insight Dilip. I absolutely believe on the trust/feature comparison. ",

      "One of the core reasons is reinventing oneself.\n\nWith AI and emerging tech (and supersmart young minds), merely upskilling is not enough.

      "The stats reveals our modern work culture\nFirst came the hustle culture; work for 80 -90 hrs/week and then people are taking sabbaticals and career breaks to catch up on health and fitness..I am being reminded of the Hare and Tortoise story much too often..The Hare sprints and then takes rest to catch its breath while the tortoise cruises along slowly and steadily.. Seems like the modern world fantasizes the hare a lot more than the tortoise.. Age old wisdom have turned upside down! ",
      "Can speak for myself. I took an 8 month long career break last year to legit work on my 'mental health and fitness'. It has helped, a lot and should be normalised. No need to be constantly running. Sometimes, a little pause is ok. Helps you get perspective.",
      "Quite a revelation! somehow the general belief is that taking care of health is time consuming which is what deters most of us to focus on it - hope it changes soon. ",
      "Prioritizing work over self because the fear of falling short of money is anxiety provoking. What most fail to realize is that when they look after their self, they can work better.",
      "Thanks for uncovering this!",
      "It will increase more in coming times. Stopping and analyzing what you really want to do is important rather than running with no goal. I am one of them."

      "The insights on resting heart rate are intriguing. I've also found the resting respiratory rate (number of breaths per minute) to be an interesting number. Humans, with a rate of 12-20 breaths/min, enjoy a lifespan of 70-80 years. Dogs, at a swift 30 breaths/min, average 10-15 years. Turtles, with a slow 1-10 breaths/min, boast a century-plus lifespan.\n\nThis interplay between physiology and lifespan is super fascinating. If truly our heartbeats and breaths are limited, then athletic performance & meditation go a long way to help increase our lifespan. I believe there is tremendous power in slowing down your resting heart rate and respiratory rate.",
      "Dilip Kumar\nThanks for sharing this!!\n\nI can send it to my friends who smoke a lot!",
      "Well said Dilip. The beneficial atomic habits add up to incremental benefits over time. The reverse is very much true. Don't let others take the driver's seat of your life. Take charge now. \nSome start a habit and then lose motivation.\nThe pain of discipline is uncomfortable.\nBut the pain of regret is unbearable.",
      "It's not just about the cigarette; it's also about mental health. The way we cope with stress, workloads, and pressures determines the habits we develop. People often smoke seeking relief from feelings that, in a way, are slowly harming them. Smoking and alcohol are not solutions. When you, as an individual, suppress your pain, you may become depressed. Coupled with alcohol and cigarettes, it further deteriorates health. It's better to express yourself.",
      "You make some thoughtful points about health being a gradual process rather than a single event. I agree that maintaining good health requires ongoing positive choices, rather than just avoiding one bad decision. Your advice to \"take control now\" is motivating - small, sustainable changes done consistently can make a big difference over time. However, it's also important to have compassion for oneself and others. Progress isn't always linear and there are many complex factors that affect health. Overall though, striving to make wise choices each day, while being patient with ourselves, can help foster wellbeing."

      "🌟",
      "Dilip Kumar In a nation which idolized Cricket as the only sport and chasing billions generated as revenues other sports, players and infra is kind of not so interesting.\nFirstly hearty congratulations 🎊 to Rohan Bopanna for this fantastic achievement. We need such milestones to inspire the next generation to make sports a lucrative career. \n\nMy standing ovation to Rohan Bopanna and all the folks behind his commitment , grit and determination to reach this goal.\n\n\nA billion population and what's our global achievement in other sports, world events ex.Fifa etc. nil for the past 75 years. \n\nWhat does it take to do good - the list is long...but do we really want to achieve or scale greatest in sports ?\n\n I doubt looking at the parody in sports governing bodies ( no offence intended)\n\nWe need to mature our thought process to excel ...that I don't foresee in our times atleast...\n\n",

    "text": "Founders, never let the investors be the judge of your passion and commitment.\n\n\nMissing good investments is the occupational hazard of venture capitalists.\nOne of the biggest learning in the past year after talking to 200+ founders is , investors can never estimate the insight a founder has to the problem statement they are solving for. A phone call or a coffee meeting will never be enough. \n\nFounder's superpower is the ability to understand user problems and build solutions that customers may not even ask for. And investors should let curiosity anchor the conversations than making conclusions based on reports or industry thesis. You may still not get it. That's fine. When you're a VC, not all bets are winners – some are just lessons.\n\nBtw, the market cap for Tesla today is $753 billion :) \nThis excerpt is from Bessemer Venture Partner anti portfolio page.",

      "I was always shy to talk about menstruation, pads, and cramps with my father. Why? You can call it social conditioning. But, now I have a daughter, who is but very young. So, now I am sensitizing my husband. When the time comes, may he be empowered to support his little girl. Every family needs to come together to break this taboo and stigma.",
      "so beautiful .... though my dad was very open to this discussion ....my neighbourhood/society wasnt .. i had to figure out so much myself",
      "Such an important topic to be discussed with daughters. Thanks for sharing the video Dilip Kumar ",
      "What a beautiful post Dilip Kumar. My daughter, almost 12 years now, speaks very openly to me about cramps, pantyliners, brand choices etc. We started our conversation with Aditi Gupta's book https://www.menstrupedia.com/. Menstrupedia gave her the confidence to be ready and also talk about it openly with me and also with her cousins and friends. It builds a different Father- Daughter bond. ",
      "1000%. We’ve been in that fight from the start and continue to push for better solutions for one part of it, Primary and secondary dysmenorrhea. Happy to share notes."

Be it corporates or startups. Employers want their teams to be healthy. And employees want to live a healthy life. \nThe mismatch is in expectations.\n\nMost employers over complicate employee wellness by pushing for programs that don't sync with everyone. But sometimes the biggest impact is driven by doing simple things. \n\nAt Zerodha & Rainmatter playing sports is an anchor that has worked well.\nNot just evangelising it but participation from top leadership to everyone in the company. \n\nFor those interested how we do this internally. This is a link to the forum where we discussed everything from event planning, creating a team, training and more. We had three teams and everyone met each other only at the event :) \n\nLink: https://lnkd.in/giV8PgBA\n\nThe upside is, now we have more folks doing events for running, triathlons, obstacle racing and more. There are groups playing some sport every weekend. And all this without any complicated employee wellness program. \nPeople just talk to each other, signup events and show up to the start line. \n\nBecoming a healthy company is not an event.\nIt's a process.",

      "This thread is pure gold https://lnkd.in/giV8PgBA \n\nVery proud of you Dilip Kumar :) ",
      "This is so heartening to see. And here we have people in academia who look down upon sporting activities. ",
      "I love the thought of Mr Nithin Kamath for being fit while working , he is leading by examples",
      "Good to see you Dilip Kumar and your teams participate at IRONMAN INDIA and the Corporate Relay Challenge in Goa. We have created that to encourage more people to take up the relay option and hoping that in turn gets them going towards their health and fitness journey. We are planning to launch a solution in the next few days to facilitate the creation of a relay team across and very encouraging to see what you are promoting within Zerodha and Rainmatter. ",
      "Well said Dilip Kumar 👏🏽👏🏽",
      "Great to see how Zerodha & Rainmatter have made it a part of their culture. Kudos to Dilip Kumar and the team for leading by example!",
      " It's truly refreshing to see how Zerodha & Rainmatter have embraced a simple yet effective approach to employee wellness. ",
      "Amazing..",
      "It's wonderful to see how Zerodha & Rainmatter prioritize employee wellness through a simple yet effective approach like sports participation.\n\nBuilding a healthy company culture is indeed an ongoing journey, and the camaraderie and motivation that come from participating in events together can make a significant difference. \n\nKudos to Nithin, Vishnu, and you for crossing that IronMan finish line as a corporate relay team! 🏊‍♂️🚴‍♂️🏃‍♂️💪",
      "A good start, well done, and thanks for sharing. \n\n However, why do people always think workplace wellness programs are centered on fitness/sports or diet? \n\nA quick reminder here; there are 8 pillars of wellness in which physical well-being is just one. Also, there are numerous markers of workplace psychological health and safety. \n\nSo, because not all needs will be met, not all measures can be funded and not all employers have the patience, there is always a need for a targeted workplace wellness program that will address these key issues backed by positive ROI or VOI or other KPIs.\n\nCorroborating your last paragraph; becoming a healthy company can never be an event (like a lavish Christmas party in the name of team bonding🤣). It's definitely a process that cannot be circumvented.\n",
      "Arun Kumar Mishra ",
      "Agree completely on the top down approach and play. And you guys do it so well from what I have seen and heard. \n\nBut I wouldn’t call all this pure/full Employee Wellness or Health (rather Holistic Health). It’s a good base, a springboard. But there are other higher levels to be reached. Wishing you guys the very best in the #Process.",
      "Great initiative ",
      "Well done Dilip!",
      "I led a health and wellness corporate program while I was in an IT job as an initiative in the past (employee base was around 2000+). \n\nDespite doing many programs across the year to serve employees from all corners of life with a lot of flexibility to ensure the programs and the benefits reached a maximum number of employees, we saw that only 20% of employees were taking a personal interest in leveraging the programs to help them improve their health and wellness. \n\nWhile opening up channels like these to encourage employees to operate by themselves is a great idea, I personally feel, we could do so much in this space to especially move the \"larger employee group who don't do a lot about their personal health\". \n\nI believe educating them about what health should mean to them, is far more important as a first step before we did a lot as an execution step in my humble view. \n\nCheers to what you guys are doing at Rainmatter and Zerodha, Dilip Kumar",
      "Very well said, Dilip…..and I mention in my talks at Indian School of Business to both budding and existing managers, Sports actually enhances Competitiveness in professional life so beneficial to both organisations & employees. This is something which has come out from research done globally.",
      "I love how Zerodha & Rainmatter prioritize employee wellness by keeping it simple and promoting sports. It's great to see the positive impact it has on everyone.",
      "Becoming a healthy company is not an event but a Process! Very Truly said, Dilip.",
      "Fantastic !! ",
      "Becoming a healthy company is not an event.\nIt's a process\n\n---> And it's a NECESSITY!!!\n\nLove this photo! It reminds me my first NY Marathon in 2017 :)\n\nHappy Saturday, Dilip Kumar!!",
      "The last 2 lines sum this up Dilip.",
      "Thank you for sharing this authentic perspective on employee wellness. Your experience shows that it need not be complex or programmatic. Often, the most powerful enabler is leadership participation and grassroots peer support.\nBy walking the talk and championing sports yourself, you've organically cultivated a culture where employees feel genuinely motivated to pursue fitness as part of work life. Enabling discussions, coordination, and crossover between various activity groups encourages camaraderie and normalization at scale.\nThis sets in motion a flywheel effect on wellbeing - as more employees share their journeys, inspiration passes on virally while hesitation reduces. Over time, the ecosystem around health goals, be it participating in marathons or something else entirely, starts thriving.\nIt's about sparking inspiration, not enforcing mandates. And you've found an excellent way to do so in a startup environment by using participation in sports as that cultural catalyst. My appreciation for you demystifying wellness - for highlighting how empowering employees to drive initiatives themselves can make companies both healthier and happier.",

Now a mother of two and an entrepreneur. \n\nIn this podcast we discussed:\n- How parents can play a role in creating future olympians.\n- The importance of sports & fitness in the personal development of a child. \n- How professional athletes train and manage life. \n- Her comeback and challenges post retirement from professional swimming.  \n- Overcoming mental health challenges. \n- Journey from an athlete to an entrepreneur.\n- The thin line between parental , societal expectations and own self. \n- Regaining her lost fitness post child birth. What worked and dint. \n- Her current training routine to be an endurance runner and CrossFit athlete.\n\nThere are a lot to takeways from this conversation and I hope this is useful to you. \n\nLinks to the full podcast\nYoutube : https://lnkd.in/gZK-KSWA\nSpotify: https://lnkd.in/gYJPct9w\nApple podcast : https://lnkd.in/gC6pW4Gg\n\nIf you are new to the podcast, you can find all the past video episodes here https://lnkd.in/gxHbvfJd",

There are no refrees , you are your coach and refree both. You are your fan and spectator. Every mile you put behind is a prize. \nThe joy of accompalishing your run be it short or long, is unique and incomparable. 'Ecstatic' is the word. 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️\n",

It's about cultivating small habits one step at a time and create an inclusive mindset rather than restriction. ",
      "This a sad statistic, in the US, and the UK the numbers are getting worst. Unfortunately the food industry has learnt  to poison us with Sugar. In the 60’s average sugar consumption was about 10lbs a year. Today it’s about 100 lbs. Sugar and the various glucose, fructose, sucrose and loaded into food. The tabacco industry moved into the food industry and plied there devious tactics to get us addicted to food.\nOnly by educating the young, and good food habits we will stem and suppress this disease.\nBR",
      "People's minds can be changed by being more open and transparent about the health benefits of minimal exercise and good eating habits.",
      "India has reached the number 7 years early. In 2011, India was forecasted to reach this number only in 2030.\n\nhttps://m.timesofindia.com/india/indiaamprsquos-diabetes-burden-to-cross-100-million-by-2030/articleshow/11101062.cms",
      "Not a surprise unfortunately.",
      "The food and beverage industry in India needs a revolution!!",
      "This is such a low hanging fruit, yet most of us walk past it. I believe most of us think that health span has a high bar to pass (because of almost unattainable beauty standards by celebrities) that we end up cuddling to our safe/comfort zones of processed foods with high sugar and high sodium. Being more open and transparent of the health benefits from minimal exercise and good eating habits by people with a strong following can trigger changes and adulation in people's minds for the better.\nThis is from personal experience."

And it took 60 mins to explain the \"Why\". \n\nI hope our conversation is useful in some way. \n\nPlease remember, becoming unhealthy is not an event. It is a process. Like a plane crash, becoming unhealthy is rarely caused by one thing going wrong. Usually, it is a series of ignorance— lack of physical exercise, compromising on sleep, food choices & stress.  All these will interact and then compound. I realised the process late in my life though. \n\nIt's very rare to meet people who are driven by genuine curiosity and passion to learn a new skill.
