The new age of fitness seems to be focused on supplements and equipment i.e. rings, watches, patches, etc etc.

No judgment on any of the above…all are good, once you have started to do the work…but, there’s no way around the actual WORK!

To put in the kind of work required for long term CONSISTENCY, one has to start with developing a stronger MINDSET.

And that, my friends, cannot be measured by rings or built on supplements.

In some cases, even the diet-fad is a cop out…easier to “cut” calories than to burn “calories.”

A couch potato on a healthy diet is still a couch potato 😀

Of course, it’s a “business” thing as well…easier to create a business around selling a physical product (supplements, measuring gadgets) than something intangible - MINDSET!

The “business” potential of MINDSET growth is still (relatively) untapped in India…mainly because the focus is still on visual aesthetics (6-pack, biceps, etc).

It’s an outstanding opportunity that would only enhance the sales of physical products…and, thankfully, it is starting to happen.",2025-08-04T12:15:25.112Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7357997583023165440,7358108297272393728)",052b12b47b2dfe13affee5582579c42770ed973ff36058af166fea10a0d35b64,urn:li:activity:7357997583023165440,667607e8d223e803437f400ae71762a50896361437d6b7a65642953020b75006

Earth (more precisely, topsoil) contains all the nutrients (70+) needed for plant growth.

We (Farmers, under the influence of agro chemical companies and the government) are constantly killing the topsoil (i.e. the billions of tiny organisms that feed plants with essential nutrition) by applying toxic chemicals (synthetic fertilizers(contact and systemic) and pesticides/herbicides/growth stimulants and many more).

The same analogy applies to our bodies.
