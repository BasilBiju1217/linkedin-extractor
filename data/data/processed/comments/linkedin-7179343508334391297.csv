Roshan Khan,https://www.linkedin.com/in/roshan-khan,"Technology & Product Leader | Platform Architecture | Operational Excellence | Engineering Strategy | Founder—HINNTS | Ex-Amadeus, Nokia, LG Soft","Hi.

I have seen many parents and players enter this journey without fully understanding the sacrifices, financial commitments, and long-term uncertainties involved. To help families make more informed decisions, I’ve put together a detailed article covering:

✔ The true cost of training and international tournaments 💰
✔ The lifestyle & education sacrifices young players make 🎓🏸
✔ The challenges of sponsorship, rankings & career longevity 🔄
✔ The mental and emotional struggles of competitive badminton 🧠🔥

📖 Read here: http://roshankhanblogs.blogspot.com/2025/02/so-you-want-to-make-your-child.html

I truly believe this is an important discussion, and it would mean a lot if you could share your thoughts or help spread awareness so more aspiring players and their families can prepare wisely.
🙌🏸
