I agree AI and predictive models can bring some improvements in the survival of infants during birth. However I afraid it will be limited to economically well parents only.

In India significant reduction infant mortality rates can be made only when proximity of public health systems and its efficiency improves so it is accesable to every Indian.

Government is spending crores to the in the form of free medicines, vaccines, nutritious food suppliment for the both mothers,  and infants. Still it need lots efforts improve its efficiency and its proper distribution.

This effectiveness public health system varies accross States as well as by Districts.

Another important factor we should be aware, that most of the births will officially get noticed or registered when the birth happens in a any form of private or public health system, or when parents willingly or responsibly do it.

That’s exactly where startups like Janitri and Spotsense are stepping in with purpose and precision.
Janitri is reimagining maternal and fetal care through affordable, AI-powered monitoring tools that work in both rural and urban setups. Their wearable devices and dashboards are helping frontline workers detect early warning signs in pregnancies—pre-eclampsia, fetal distress, delayed labor—before they turn fatal.
SpotSense is another game-changer. They’re building low-cost, point-of-care diagnostics for neonatal sepsis—one of the biggest killers in the first few weeks of life. Using saliva-based biosensors, they’re detecting infections faster than conventional blood culture systems.

This resonates deeply. I'm sorry for your friend's loss - losing a child is unimaginable.
You're absolutely right about the AI potential in healthcare, and I think the scope is even broader than the 2.5% post-birth mortality you mentioned.
Looking at the complete picture in India: out of every 1,000 pregnancies, roughly 169 don't result in a healthy baby surviving the first year. This includes ~100 miscarriages, ~26 stillbirths, and ~43 infant deaths. That's nearly 17% of all pregnancies.

This is, of course, speaking from personal experience of building Mindei's preventive and early detection tools from a mental health risk perspective.

The real challenge has been implementation and providing quality care in a public healthcare system setting. This is the case even when the newborns are already identified. Data is often altered/missed to avoid admitting these newborns, to drive the hospital mortality rate down. 

There are proven solutions based on decades of research, but they are just not implemented well. Ansh is working on it. 

Early diagnosis of newborn sepsis is missing. But then the challenge is low-cost market expectation leaving less incentive to heavily invest in research. An advance market commitment might solve this though.

Dr Sudip Chowdhury,https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-sudip-chowdhury-b69a8818,Senior Consultant @ Fortis Healthcare | Medical Research | Quality improvement | Healthcare Leadership,"Neonatal mortality remains significantly higher in rural India (~1.5x urban). While national rates have dropped to ~25/1,000 live births (2021 numbers). The urban numbers are not that drastic, but still alarming. It also shows variations in states etc, like in urban karnataka it is 8/1000. Neonatal deaths occur many times due to sepsis which is preventable by rigorous hygeine at hospital and home. While the urban areas have better private sector hospitals, rural areas mainly depend on government infrastructure which is deplorable in many states. Many NGOs are working on this part, teaching hygeine to parents and working on best practices in hospitals. Predictive power of death from sepsis in Neonates are high with guidelines available which doctors are aware of. 
So, I believe that neonatal mortality can be better prevented from best practices and pure hygeine , handwashing rather than AI models. More than that, the real place of need is rural india where penetration of basic technology is pretty low.

Detecting risks in healthcare isn’t the hard part anymore. AI-driven predictive and mitigation tools are ready. The real challenge lies in adoption and monetisation.

Startups like ours, #MonkDB, have built AI-native platform that can solve real problems. We’ve identified 30+ healthcare use cases and piloted several. Yet, we see limited traction, especially in India.

Hospitals hesitate to adopt, delay payments, or don't prioritise tech investment. Many startups risk dying before scaling.

The numbers are painful, but what’s worse is how avoidable many of these tragedies are. When 60% of infant deaths are preventable, it’s not just a statistic — it’s a call to action.

AI has real potential here: not to replace care, but to extend its reach — especially in areas where infrastructure is thin. From early risk stratification to remote diagnostics, the tech already exists. What’s missing is deployment at scale, and the will to prioritize it.

There’s so much talent in India’s healthtech space. Hopefully this post nudges more of it toward problems that truly matter.",2025-07-09T05:29:22.394Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7348579224074539008,7348584028121219072)",ccb55922432fbba6abed099ab62a7401a09500777b9d8659722a0f03f6657843,urn:li:activity:7348579224074539008,46e8b21dfc4a6900597991d2d73a5c2ac069e6cb454306e2b45e79ceee156d37

MAXINOV.COM | MOHDSUFYAN.COM,"Absolutely resonated with this. Having spent the last 20 years evaluating innovations, patents, and emerging tech (large part of my work has been in health tech), I can say that predictive models, AI diagnostics, remote monitoring, and historical health data modeling do have great potential to improve outcomes. But I think the biggest challenges are not due to the absence of such technologies particularly in Indian context. In fact, in many cases the risk is already known to doctors, to health workers, sometimes even to the family. Yet the tragedy still unfolds. Because of gaps in awareness, social and behavioral factors, resource limitations, infrastructure constraints, and lack of action for some other reasons. These are systemic, not technological, barriers. That said, technology must still be built, and smartly. Not just to predict, but to integrate meaningfully into care pathways .",2025-07-09T05:24:39.025Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7348579224074539008,7348582839585513472)",d0ced3090ecfb05664c86568b5366bf0cae2f6e5395ff783016743e877dc5c88,urn:li:activity:7348579224074539008,46e8b21dfc4a6900597991d2d73a5c2ac069e6cb454306e2b45e79ceee156d37
