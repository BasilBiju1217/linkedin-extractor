Prasad V L,https://www.linkedin.com/in/prasadvl,CEO & Managing Director at Teligenz Tech Solutions Pvt Ltd,"I have noticed a pattern - that these topics usually get mired in debates around what works and what doesn’t work, what is good, what is bad, etc.

There are enough people who will vouch for intermittent fasting - whereas there will be others who will vouch for not fasting, and eating small meals multiple times a day.

There are people who will say don’t eat X, and others who will say, eat only X! And no matter what X is, you will find someone to fight for it!

And there are some, like Warren Buffet who eat burgers and drink Coke - and are fully fit at 90!

For such an important topic, something that impacts everyone, the level of confusion you see, is simply mind boggling!

Invariably, the point that gets lost in all the noise - is that it’s not about which specific model you adopt. It’s about the fact that you adopt it fully - not just pick and choose what suits you, what is convenient!
