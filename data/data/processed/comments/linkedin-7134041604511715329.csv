Olayinka Opaleye,https://www.linkedin.com/in/olayinkaopaleye,"I implement targeted wellness initiatives in the workplace to address identified employee needs to enhance overall health, productivity, and job satisfaction through corporate wellness and health promotion strategies.","A good start, well done, and thanks for sharing. 

 However, why do people always think workplace wellness programs are centered on fitness/sports or diet? 

A quick reminder here; there are 8 pillars of wellness in which physical well-being is just one. Also, there are numerous markers of workplace psychological health and safety. 

So, because not all needs will be met, not all measures can be funded and not all employers have the patience, there is always a need for a targeted workplace wellness program that will address these key issues backed by positive ROI or VOI or other KPIs.

Corroborating your last paragraph; becoming a healthy company can never be an event (like a lavish Christmas party in the name of team bonding🤣). It's definitely a process that cannot be circumvented.

Despite doing many programs across the year to serve employees from all corners of life with a lot of flexibility to ensure the programs and the benefits reached a maximum number of employees, we saw that only 20% of employees were taking a personal interest in leveraging the programs to help them improve their health and wellness. 

While opening up channels like these to encourage employees to operate by themselves is a great idea, I personally feel, we could do so much in this space to especially move the ""larger employee group who don't do a lot about their personal health"". 

I believe educating them about what health should mean to them, is far more important as a first step before we did a lot as an execution step in my humble view.

Venkatesh Haran,https://www.linkedin.com/in/vharan,Senior Patent Counsel,"Thank you for sharing this authentic perspective on employee wellness. Your experience shows that it need not be complex or programmatic. Often, the most powerful enabler is leadership participation and grassroots peer support.
By walking the talk and championing sports yourself, you've organically cultivated a culture where employees feel genuinely motivated to pursue fitness as part of work life. Enabling discussions, coordination, and crossover between various activity groups encourages camaraderie and normalization at scale.
This sets in motion a flywheel effect on wellbeing - as more employees share their journeys, inspiration passes on virally while hesitation reduces. Over time, the ecosystem around health goals, be it participating in marathons or something else entirely, starts thriving.
It's about sparking inspiration, not enforcing mandates. And you've found an excellent way to do so in a startup environment by using participation in sports as that cultural catalyst.
