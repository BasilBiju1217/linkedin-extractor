We are helping doctors in diagnosis of neurological conditions using EEG combined with AI. Here our AI can be combined with existing EEG machines and we also have our own EEG portable device to help in remote at home EEG monitoring of patients. 

Our first product here is a real time seizure forecasting solution which predicts seizures upto 5 mins before they come. This helps doctors and nurses in hospitals to monitor patients and take preventive actions. At home, our product helps reduce fear associated with uncertain occurrence of seizures.

We are building CYCLESYNC, an AI-powered period tracker that helps women track their cycles, flag symptoms of PCOS and hormonal imbalances, and personalize their diet, fitness, and work routines based on their cycle phases.
Tailoring daily habits to the menstrual cycle is essential because a woman’s hormones influence energy levels, mood, and productivity throughout the month. By aligning diet, exercise, and work schedules to these natural changes, women can clinically improve their health, reduce stress, and enhance their overall well-being.

At Dēha, we are building a cutting-edge personal training studio dedicated to healing and empowering individuals dealing with chronic pain, while helping them achieve optimal fitness.

Our unique approach integrates:
	•	Diaphragm Function & Breathing: Improving core stability and functional movement.
	•	Rehabilitation: Helping clients recover effectively and avoid invasive surgeries.
	•	Strength Training: Ensuring long-term resilience and improved performance.

We understand that the site of pain is often not the root cause. For example, knee pain may stem from poor foot mechanics or limited hip mobility. That’s why we go beyond conventional methods with a comprehensive biomechanics assessment to identify movement restrictions and dysfunctions throughout the body.

Our evidence-based methodology helps restore natural movement patterns, re-educates the body, and allows our clients to live pain-free, active lives. This innovative, holistic approach has already transformed the lives of individuals struggling with pain, enabling them to avoid surgeries and regain confidence in their bodies.",2024-12-31T10:58:44.964Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7279724087365513218,7279813223887843328)",cd0e9a3c4ffedeb2b719b413bff88b59c4f7cce1ff1d21c06e5327796f618742,urn:li:activity:7279724087365513218,2b3da2282a076c94ed0fa3ce6a9b79733c9ce115a478cbda008a8d3e7a0aac20

It is essentially a technology implementation of the concepts presented in the book Atomic Habits by James Clear, applied to the personal health improvement context. We have come up with 20 atomic habits which can improve one's health, and dramatically if these habits are stacked on top of each other. These habits together constitute the '1Step Approach' and belong to one of 3 categories: 1) Build a Solid Foundation, 2) Strengthen the Body, and 3) Strengthen the Mind.

There are a couple of neat GenAI use cases in this app which we are implementing right now and will be live in a couple of months. And of course, ML will be required to 'hyper-personalize' the '1Step Approach' for every user.

1Step has 3 modules: Learn, Do, and Track.
1) 'Learn' module contains self-paced courses, live courses, and expert talks.
2) 'Do' module contains atomic habits to improve one's health (10 to begin with) as well as online classes (3 to begin with).
3) 'Track' module contains ways to track the changes that people go through when they start making changes to their diet, exercise, and lifestyle.

1. We are sick not because there are not enough doctors or technology is missing to bring people under redar of doctors.
2. Autism/ ADHD is a biochemical disorder in body not just merely a behavioural disorder 
3. Most chronic diseases are not genetic in nature that we should only rely on drugs 
4. Medical education is algorithmic training focused mostly on sickness care. No focus on understanding root cause of disease/ nutrition/ know how about body ability to regenerate and repair 
5. Drugs are good for emergency use not a solution for chronic illness 
6. Body is made out from nutrition. Macro nutrients are fats, proteins and phospholipids
7. Most chronic illnesses are rising due to dysfunction of mitochondrial health
