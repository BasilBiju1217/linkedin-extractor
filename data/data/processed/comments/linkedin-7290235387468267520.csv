And even they have low success rate in reversing or managing this via lifestyle interventions. Even if we consider an aggressive 50% success rate and assume they cater to 5% of the population data, at best we can expect a 2.5 % improvement. 

The unhealthy snack alternatives cost 5-10 X and have limited distribution. 

The diabetes monitoring, trackers, lifestyle solutions cost over 30K per year (metformin and statins costs around 3-5K per year) 

When one buys a ""so called"" unhealthy snack they are not buying food, they are buying convenience (in fact convenience was the marketing positioning of this in the 60s and 70s when packaged industry started along with women liberation) ... But the so called healthy snacks now are also not selling food - they are also selling convenience. Why does one need to spend 150 Rs on a protein bar or shake when one can get that much protein from milk, eggs, paneer at 1/5th of the cost - because the bar is convenient. 

IMHO - the one and only thing that can create a lasting and wide impact is awareness and education.

1. Don’t outsource their health to the system: No app/ ring/ band/ gym course is going to get you moving more consciously and consistently than your brain.
2. Play & sports is nature’s way of making kids fit: There is no right or wrong way to play a sport that makes the child happy. Parents who want to make professional sportsperson from their kids miss the point.
3. Parents think kids should ‘want’ to exercise or eat well:  Specification by example works best. As a parent you set wrong example every time you order 10 minute food delivery for your cravings and skip your workout for a binge watch of Netflix
4. The mainstream food industry is a trap: It includes all protein fortified, antioxidant, vitamin enriched food that gets advertised and shared. They are in to business for making money not making people healthy!
