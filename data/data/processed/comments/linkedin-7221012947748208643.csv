Why hate on them as most people do.

And totally agree on the 'speak your mind' part - people do not realise the power of their own voice. I frequently share grouses and even compliments on some major companies on personal experience and 100% of the time, it makes an impact. I even posted on Indigo, the monopoly airline and their below average service over a few weeks when I took several flights - apart from huge engagement and people sharing the same sentiment, the Airline and very senior director level folks immediately responded 1-1 over calls and it showed they cared. Same for many companies.
