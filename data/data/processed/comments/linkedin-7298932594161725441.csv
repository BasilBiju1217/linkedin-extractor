Venkata Krishnan Somasundaram,https://www.linkedin.com/in/venkatakrishnan-s,Learning - eliminating assumptions...,"Breaking the problem:

1. I think the same applies to any ""one"" career one might choose, it becomes a single point of failure for ""most"" people. I have heard this from a swimming instructor/ coach: 1 life 3 careers (practiced in Germany?). This helps in life beyond sports for professionals. This applies to anyone in normal walks of life as well I guess.

2. Irrespective sports must be played for fun or passion and the discipline, and the outcomes must be a by-product and I feel there is often a rat race in every sport in many countries and on top of that, in most cases the parents/ guardian of the kids are responsible for kid's journey, this happens more often in growing economies like India. It takes 2-3 generations to build sports into the genes of a nation (physically - naturally).

3. Most people do not know the donts and do's of any sport, and they practice it without understanding the science behind (bio mechanics, nutrition, character building etc)",2025-03-06T01:27:45.760Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7298932594161725441,7303224741631311872)",f69b88a58ca0a75596a9d600623943429e05243ea49e9dfaed377bd67906a168,urn:li:activity:7298932594161725441,35f64225e0865ae4cd6fb56f1c2853d160b02cbf01411c87438e8e8dd666d339

It is not a failure if one does not get into a national team. If that is the thinking behind playing sports, then one should look at why one studies engineering, medicine, or any other discipline. Not every engineer will become CTO, or every doctor will become Surgeon General.

We have shot the bullet on our feet by encouraging mindless glorification of wins in major events.

The baseline reference for success, according to me needs to be relooked into.

The sports governing bodies must be made accountable to have LTDP.
Democratizing the structures, in my view can give us much needed lever to make things work.

Unless we set the context of ""why sports?"" and have a very powerful and most inclusive answer to this question, all the solutions will boomrang.

In reality there are no eco-system. Ecosystem is constituted by it's stakeholders. So if we pivot our understanding from this. The question that emerges is which organisation / institution  or individual in India has what at stake ???
The athelete and parents and coaches at the grassroots who have huge stakes doen not matter to the leaders at the helm of the affairs. These leaders are Sports ministry, SAI, International Bodies of Sports and National, State Federations.

3. One problem is that kids are expected to pick their career by the age of 15, and stick with the rest of their life! That is an unrealistic expectation. We should encourage people to switch careers later in life. Nothing  wrong in continuing education later in life. I know people in the US go to Undergrad or Post Grad education as late as their 50s. People change their careers late in life, and multiple times. 

4. Hiring managers should not disregard people changing their careers later in life. The hiring process should only focus on one question ""Can this person do the job I want to hire them for?"" It doesn't matter when they switched to that job, or went to school for it.

5. Students with an active Sports background develop many soft skills that can help them succeed - team work, perseverance, coachability, hard work, and many more.",2025-02-28T17:25:14.224Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7298932594161725441,7301291370760089600)",3f0e18e65abf37477e01795fa8f1a90734a316f31cdd4174b38c639a4c8a8e72,urn:li:activity:7298932594161725441,35f64225e0865ae4cd6fb56f1c2853d160b02cbf01411c87438e8e8dd666d339

This will be the same as failing without trying for a person who is interested in sports.

Mr. Gopichand Should demand a system managed by the government which allows

1. Inexpensive training Arenas with fully equipped facility for people who wish to go into sports.
2. Teachers recruited by the government for training in those arenas with equal pay rights.

Higher the no. Of people participating higher the chances of goods talents actually appearing on top, and that 1% can atleast become 1.5% given we will have a strong base so more people will get the medals for the country.

Jayaram Srinivasan,https://www.linkedin.com/in/jayaramsrinivasan69,"Co-founder and CTO, Moolaah.com, Alphaamoney, Finmoo","Gopi is right.
Sports are for the extreme rich and extreme poor.

Example - Sons of Rich guys like Kumara Mangalam Birla, Tendulkar's son, Rahul Dravid's Son etc. 

Reason is simple, rich becomes complacent and lazy. Sports means - need to work hard, take proper care of health and results are measurable. Will teach you that win/lose is not guaranteed and makes you more matured as you get to realize that success/failure is not directly proportional to efforts and so many things like team/situation/weather and other things play a role.

For the poor, anyway, nothing to lose and there is a lot of support and money in sports these days. You can show your hunger and character and make it big.

Last thing a middle class guy should do is to send their kids to sports as it is highly risky. Kids will end with super rich who don't care about money and super poor who don't have anything to lose. Lot of kids come and go in-between and if you lose out on important years (8th to 12th) you will end up as illiterate who cannot study complex stuff like mathematics, science, finance etc.

It is also dangerous for middle class kids to hang around with illiterate kids and illiterate support staff and management in our sports ecosystem.

I fully agree that you have to plan for a career after the sports stint - and I believe athletes in the US plan for it, and good ones also are financially prudent with their investments early on! Sports is a formal industry here. 

Wish there were more folks in India who were passionate about formalizing this career path and think of how skills learned here (and they’re valuable) can be leveraged in another fields. For example, in the US, being a military veteran can be a prized background in corporate backgrounds. Could there be something similar in India as well?

BUT, this should not be a blanket statement that we agree with and let be…I’d be interested in having a conversation w you or even a webinar type group chat with a few folks, like yourself, who actually want to understand and help solve the problem vs just posting about it.

Sports can be a great way to come out of poverty…like in the US…so why can’t it be the same here?

There is plenty of money in India that can change the face of sports in the country…question is how and where is it being deployed.

This is where you see our short-term thinking i.e. what’s the immediate ROI…so, not truly an “investment.”

The vision needs to be “ballsy” and long-term.

Even in Cricket, try getting funds to setup an academy/national talent scouting program or knowledge center for cricket-related jobs VS funding/sponsorship/advertising for an IPL tournament…right there you will understand the difference between investment myopia and hyperopia 😀

And when you talk about making a career in sport, it’s not just as an elite athlete. Yes of course, most might have dreamt of becoming one, but that doesn’t mean there are no other ways to work in the industry. 

However, ground realities don’t really support  both side of careers unless you come from a privileged background. People are severely underpaid, and most organisations are exploiting the passion driven youth who have chosen sport as a career. 

I have come across many cases of not just players but also the staff of clubs and  corporates alike, not getting paid their promised salaries. Such players are left helpless and cashless, moving on - while their previous workplace finds another person willing to be underpaid or has no idea that they might never get paid.

Katie H.,https://www.linkedin.com/in/katieharrington,Simplify. Align. Accelerate. Strategic Advisor | Business Operations Consultant | Transformation Partner,"When I was young, and my father was starting his company, we were not rich but managed to have enough to play a variety of sports. I’m grateful for the sacrifices my parents made to allow me to explore. 

The return on investment for kids to play a sport is huge. Socially, it introduces them to kids from all different socioeconomic backgrounds, mentally, it teaches them grit & resilience which is an immeasurable benefit throughout their entire life and physically, I don’t think we even need to go into the childhood obesity epidemic. If kids look to professional athletes and use that to drive and motivate them in ways similar to adults looking at CEO’s and entrepreneurs and say, “I want that, I can do that!”,  I think it’s normal and natural.  Things go awry when parents push their kids to be someone else. Letting your kid lead and start their own engine. If you’re constantly “starting your kid’s engine” (quoting the great Pat Summitt) to be something and getting resistance, it’s not worth it financially, mentally emotionally. Let them develop a passion and reap the benefits of sports. I think parents play a role in the introduction of sports and kids take the resigns from there. The return on investment is huge in the end.",2025-02-22T15:54:31.399Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7298932594161725441,7299094214703808513)",a03ed736c769a448f7a50067e6ed33813e8191df8028d93f910d7fa877e7efa3,urn:li:activity:7298932594161725441,35f64225e0865ae4cd6fb56f1c2853d160b02cbf01411c87438e8e8dd666d339
