Shakthi Sairam,https://www.linkedin.com/in/shakthisairamtech,Building a bionic arm for India @Symbionic,"Taking this train of thought a step further, I feel like the interpretation of the data and research involved wrt improvement in fitness causes a lot of friction for people pursuing any fitness goal. 

Along with the HOW biomarkers are changing and WHY they are, if there was a way to continously suggest areas of improvement and tactics from personalized data collection, it would remove a great deal of friction from the process and possibly increase adherence.  

I believe this is done on a case by case basis by personal trainers and nutritionists now, but could be done on a larger scale with the right methods to collect the personalized data. (Mostly because finding good nutrionists and personal trainers who are trustworthy is hard, which I exactly what believe Fittr is solving)

PS: Will it be possible for you to share the 500+ companies solving for health/fitness in a repository of some sort?, I'm sure it would be helpful for a lot of us.

Knowing almost everything you are doing everyday and everything happening everyday with you. For example: That tech should know that today you have some fierce talk with your wife and you are upset or today you got your salary with a bonus and you are surprisingly happy, literally everything it should know to give you the best answer for why or how there are any good or bad changes in your health or could happen, or there is any room to make the things better. 

There should be an AI chip implanted in the brain that can analyse the neurological links, process it and send required output to your wearable devices. Or maybe something similar which can tell almost everything about you and feed that data to AI. 

Best of luck to those who are going to make such Advanced and Accurate AI, but even if it gets developed , there would be many hurdles to get it positioned in the market. 👍",2024-04-15T11:44:37.222Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7185511912204316672,7185603922638561280)",ef77e5a4a178d3d8d286d6e52b3c5dcb5d283b00e60e8b0c395110cf001805ad,urn:li:activity:7185511912204316672,5f41475e705d2cbb3f181e5b20e81dfc7493bfc57b683c1c169d5b86de790ca3

Great insights! At WTF Gyms , we're on the same wavelength. Our app doesn't just track metrics; it explains the 'why' behind them. We're leaping ahead, focusing on nutrition, daily workouts, and essential body metrics. It's about showing members where they start on day 1 and guiding them towards their goals, spotlighting what's changing and why. This approach is already making a difference for us.

Absolutely agree with you — understanding the 'why' is crucial. It's not just about finding the reason but sticking to it and ensuring it doesn't become just another statistic. Your thoughts have sparked even more ideas for us, and thanks to this, we're excited to soon offer the WTF app to non-subscribers too. We want everyone to benefit from our scheduling system, nutritional guidance, and core tech features.

Most folks care about only outcomes. So long as there is a basic explanation on how food and the human body work, it’s sufficient to bring awareness. Likewise all analytical tools only tell you if things are going right/wrong. The hardest challenge is behaviour changing for sustainable health. This is a complex problem being influenced by childhood behaviour, work, family, environment, physiology, emotions etc. The ones that benefit from say RHR, HRV are the ones who are already deeply into fitness and health.

However, there is huge gap before wearables could decode. The current wearable tech is nothing but a small pie in disease management opportunity.

 For instance, CGM can tell you spike in blood glucose/blood sugar response/levels. But this does not help until we have info & data on GLUT 4- the protein that goes to cell membrane, bind to glucose, clear it from circulation & transport to cell for storage or energy. Therefore data on molecular signalling that activates GLUT 4 is the key.

Similarly, we may know HRV but unless we decode /measure norepinephrine and epinephrine levels or histamine signalling, HRV is of no use

Bibin Radhakrishnan,https://www.linkedin.com/in/bibinrkoff,Progress not perfection!,"In my experience building an Electronic Health Record(EHR) this is extremely difficult to implement.

Here's why: Root cause diagnosis has to be done by General Medicine doctors and not specialists because only root cause can tell exactly ""Why"" and this is how the process would flow for that:

Chief Complaint/Symptom
Clinical Finding
Differential Diagnosis
Chronic conditions(if any)
Genetic conditions(if any)
Social Behaviours that can cause a condition
Allergies
And Lab Tests to validate

All these factors are necessary to know WHY. Now am assuming that you don't want it to exactly be a 100% but if it's not atleast ""quite accurate"" then the ""Why"" can scare the customer especially since most of the these wearables have a lot of inaccuracies. And having all this data captured by a wearable or otherwise is an expensive affair in my experience.

And most importantly the ""Why"" is difficult even for a doctor to find.

Example, there is a company solving for UTI diagnostics, they're created a completely new method for it. Another company is finding absolutely new ways to diagnose breast cancer early on.
