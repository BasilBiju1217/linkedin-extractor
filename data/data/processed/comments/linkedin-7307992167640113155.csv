This is such a solid take! 

The whole ""Uber of Healthcare"" narrative oversimplifies a deeply complex system. 

Healthcare isn't just about transactions; it's about trust, continuity, and outcomes.

Tech can absolutely help, but not in the way most startups imagine—slapping AI on everything and calling it ""disruption"" isn’t the answer. 

Instead, the real impact comes from augmenting the system: improving diagnostics, streamlining supply chains, ensuring medicine authenticity, and empowering frontline workers.

It’s refreshing to see a take that focuses on first principles rather than just chasing scale. 

The biggest wins in healthcare won’t come from the flashiest tech but from solving real, foundational problems.",2025-03-19T10:43:20.741Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7307992167640113155,7308075600928202753)",c8131c3f521ef9a2632d982b084c259366ab7f1e94b7f2e2b56ab682aa98c595,urn:li:activity:7307992167640113155,a1def6fa43ef6ce3ae50d02381f784cb6a4fd81bc4dd76a337e3dda17dd5e6b7

Too many startups believe better UI + AI chatbot = healthcare revolution. But healthcare isn’t a checkout cart—it’s a life-and-death relationship.

Biggest takeaway? Tech should augment, not replace.

- AI can assist doctors, but it won’t replace experience and trust.
- A sleek app won’t fix supply chain chaos or fake medicine issues.
- Scaling care isn’t about matching patients to doctors—it’s about ensuring follow-up, outcomes, and real impact.

Hitesh Chopra,https://www.linkedin.com/in/hiteshchopra1,Technology Leadership – AI & Business Strategy @ Early-Stage AI Ventures | Executive MBA,"Very informative, Tech alone won’t fix Indian healthcare, where doctor shortages (1:1,511), poor rural access (600M people), and 20% counterfeit drugs persist. Unlike e-commerce, healthcare needs trust, continuity, and affordability not just AI chatbots or doctor-matching apps. The real opportunity is in augmenting care- scaling AI-assisted frontline workers, securing drug supply chains, and improving patient outcomes.

What if we see the world as not broken but as something that’s evolving. 

When we see it as broken we reject it! If you break a bone, see the Dr. If it breaks twice, increase calcium and get healthier. 

If it breaks thrice, then go to a Therapist to understand what you need to do in your frequency. 

It’s evolution, healthcare needs to evolve to cover all aspects of health.",2025-03-19T05:24:57.775Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7307992167640113155,7307995477285695488)",fecd2fed229d9760614f7be6b729ec0facfa44523148a6ff3719e10be8c450cb,urn:li:activity:7307992167640113155,a1def6fa43ef6ce3ae50d02381f784cb6a4fd81bc4dd76a337e3dda17dd5e6b7
