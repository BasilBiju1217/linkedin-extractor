I believe that “walking the talk” so to speak not only gives you credibility but is in fact essential to building a health & wellness building. Beyond the superficiality of what one looks like, it is the ability to understand the space you operate in, the solutions you are building for your target customers, and the confidence that you have when you yourself have successfully tried those, that gives you a winning edge. For example, in my case, I can definitely say that my own journey has largely influences the growth of our organisation and the path we have taken towards growth. The community which I cherish the most is a function of the connect I have been able to build with people and this has only been possible because I truly embibe what I talk about.
